Title: Facile spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy for the discrimination of alpha and beta thalassemia traits and diseases: A photodiagnosis approach.
Abstract: Thalassemia (Thal) is an inherited blood disorder endemic to the Mediterranean and Middle East (e.g., KSA and UAE). This disease is caused by defects in the synthesis of one or more hemoglobin chains in red blood cells (RBCs). Alpha (alpha) Thal is caused by a reduced or absent alpha globin segment. Similarly, beta (beta) Thal is caused by a defect in the beta globin segment. We divided the diseases into four groups: alpha Thal trait, alpha Thal disease, beta Thal trait, and beta Thal disease. The alpha or beta Thal traits are milder variants of these diseases and do not require treatment; but beta Thal disease (and to a lesser extent, alpha Thal) causes hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and bone deformities and requires repeated lifelong blood transfusions. This paper presents results regarding the identification of Thal variants using fluorescence spectroscopy of blood biomolecules and atomic force microscopy analysis of the morphologic features of red blood cells. The combined results provide new insights into the characteristics of these diseases. Furthermore, this study shows why beta Thal disease subjects are often transfusion-dependent, and alpha Thal disease subjects are only occasionally transfusion dependent.
