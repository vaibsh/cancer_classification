Title: Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA)-related overgrowth spectrum: A brief report.
Abstract: A patient with extensive multisystem overgrowth caused by a somatic gain of function PIK3CA-mutation is described. This case is an example of the clinical diversity of the PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) as the patient had overlapping features of Congenital Lipomatous Overgrowth Vascular malformations Epidermal nevi and Skeletal abnormalities (CLOVES) syndrome and Megalencephaly-Capillary malformation Polymicrogyria (MCAP) syndrome and underlines the utility of this umbrella term.
