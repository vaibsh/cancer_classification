Title: Tension haemothorax from a bleeding branch of the renal artery following isolated penetrating thoracic trauma: a rare presentation.
Abstract: A 27-year-old man presented to a major trauma centre with two posterolateral thoracic stab injuries over the right scapula and thoracoabdominal junction. He was tachycardic and hypotensive with a chest X-ray revealing a large right-sided tension haemothorax, requiring insertion of two intercostal chest drains. A subsequent CT scan demonstrated a grade 4 right kidney laceration with active back bleeding from a renal artery branch, through a right diaphragmatic defect, into the pleural cavity. Embolisation of the feeding renal vessel controlled the bleeding and avoided the need for a nephrectomy. The patient required subsequent video-assisted thoracoscopic evacuation of the haemothorax and diaphragmatic repair, confirming that there was no associated lung or major vessel injury. A ureteric stent was ultimately inserted to manage a persistent urinary leak. This case highlights a rare cause for a common traumatic presentation and the need for a multidisciplinary approach in effective management of complex, multiorgan trauma.
