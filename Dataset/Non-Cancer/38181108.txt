Title: Treatment and Outcomes of 4,973 Unicameral Bone Cysts: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
Abstract: » Unicameral bone cysts (UBCs) can increase the risk of pathologic fractures of both long and short bones. Although multiple treatments exist, data are conflicting regarding optimal management. » We sought to analyze treatment strategies for UBCs and their rates of successful treatment. » Success rates were analyzed according to treatment modality, with emphasis on filling techniques and/or decompression associated with curettage, and injection compounds. » Curettage with bone substitute and cyst decompression was identified as a highly successful technique for UBC treatment. » Decompressing the cyst wall after injection, regardless of the specific compound used, had a greater potential to enhance healing rates. » The management decision should be individually guided within the patient's context.
