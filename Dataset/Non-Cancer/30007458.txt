Title: Bone Marrow Expression of Mast Cell Disorders.
Abstract: Mast cell disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of rare diseases, the diagnosis of which still remains a challenge. Bone marrow analysis constitutes the most appropriate site for screening systemic involvement in mastocytosis. Morphologic, immunohistochemical, flow cytometric immunophenotyping, and molecular studies should be routinely performed for diagnostic/prognostic purposes in experienced reference centers during the diagnostic workup in suspected systemic mastocytosis. The authors review the most relevant characteristics of bone marrow expression of mast cell disorders as well as the different methodological approaches to be applied to perform an objective and reproducible diagnosis and classification of mastocytosis and other mast cell disorders.
