Title: Radiation retinopathy treated successfully with aflibercept.
Abstract: Aflibercept (aflibercept) is a novel anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drug indicated for wet age-related macular degeneration and macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular oedema. While only newly introduced on the market, it is growing in popularity and over 5.5 million doses have been prescribed worldwide. Due to its versatile mechanism, it is indicated for numerous eye pathologies, and in particular, has been adapted to treat various types of retinopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of solely using aflibercept to treat cystoid macular oedema in radiation retinopathy.
