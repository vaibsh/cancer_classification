Title: Reassessment of the NF1 variants of unknown significance found during the 20-year activity of a genetics diagnostic laboratory.
Abstract: The finding of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the activity of a diagnostic genetic laboratory is a common issue, which is however provisional and needs to be periodically re-evaluated, due to the continuous advancements in our knowledge of the genetic diseases. Neurofibromatosis type 1, caused by the occurrence of heterozygous pathogenic NF1 variants, is a good model for studying the evolution of VUS, due to the widespread use of genetic testing for the disease, the constant enrichment of the international databases with NF1 variants and the full adult penetrance of the disease, which makes genotyping the parents a crucial step in the diagnostic workflow. The present study retrospectively reviewed and reinterpreted the genetic test results of NF1 in a diagnostic genetic laboratory in the period from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2020. All the VUS were reinterpreted using the 2015 consensus standards and guidelines for the interpretation. Out of 589 NF1 genetic tests which were performed in the period, a total of 85 VUS were found and reinterpreted in 72 cases (84.7%): 21 (29.2%) were reclassified as benign/likely benign, whereas 51 (70.8%) were recoded as pathogenic/likely pathogenic with a significant trend distribution (Chi square test for trend p = 0.005). Synonymous VUS have mainly been reclassified as class 1 and 2 (7/8, 87.5%), whereas missense variants have been attributed to class 4 and 5 in 38 out of the 58 cases (65.5%). These findings underline an improvement in the classification of variants over time, suggesting that a reinterpretation of the genetic tests should be routinely performed to support the physicians in the clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases.
