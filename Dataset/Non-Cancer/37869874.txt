Title: Retrospective pharmacogenetic study in a cohort of pediatric tuberous sclerosis complex patients using everolimus.
Abstract: <b>Aim:</b> Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare disease that produces multisystemic disorders. Everolimus (EVR) is the only immunosuppressive drug approved to control the symptoms and progression of the disease. The aim was to evaluate the genotype-phenotype association to improve the pediatric TSC pharmacotherapeutic outcome. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Ten pediatric TSC patients were recruited. Concomitant treatment and main metabolic enzymes and transporter coding gene variants of EVR were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Significant associations were found between <i>CYP3A4*22</i> allele and concomitant treatment with valproic acid (CYP3A4-inhibitor) with a poor metabolizer phenotype and the presence of pneumonia. <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first pharmacogenetic study of EVR in pediatric TSC patients. The authors propose to consider concomitant treatment and pharmacogenetics due to their multifactorial status.
