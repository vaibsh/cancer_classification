Title: Cutaneous Mastocytosis in Adults and Children: New Classification and Prognostic Factors.
Abstract: The skin is one of the most frequent tissues affected in patients with mastocytosis, but cutaneous lesions are highly heterogeneous in shape, size, color, number, localization, and distribution. The World Health Organization recognizes 3 subtypes of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM): maculopapular CM (MPCM), diffuse CM, and mastocytoma of skin. An international task force of experts in mastocytosis has recently proposed subdividing MPCM into monomorphic and polymorphic, which could predict the duration of the disease in children. More research is warranted to develop an improved classification of CM that ideally should incorporate robust factors with prognostic impact on disease behavior.
