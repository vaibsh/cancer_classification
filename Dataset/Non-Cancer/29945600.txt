Title: Membrane-bound and soluble forms of an NMDA receptor extracellular domain retain epitopes targeted in auto-immune encephalitis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (ANRE) is a potentially lethal disease attributed to auto-antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Full recovery is possible if therapy is initiated early in the disease course. Detection of ANRE antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential for diagnosis. The assays for ANRE-associated IgGs often rely on cells transiently transfected with NMDAR genes. A cell line that stably expresses pathogenic NMDAR epitopes could improve standardization of the assays and provide antigen that could be used in commercial solid state assay systems. RESULTS: We expressed the amino terminal domain (ATD) of the GluN1 NMDAR subunit (NR1) as a fusion protein on the outer plasma membrane of 293T cells, creating a stable cell population (293T-ATD) that is recognized by ANRE patient monoclonal antibodies in flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays. The ATD fusion protein also contains a Myc tag and a 6XHIS tag, which provide functionality for immunoassays and antigen purification, and a TEV protease site, which allows the ATD domain to be specifically released from the cells in essentially pure form. ATD mobilized from the 293T ATD cell line maintained the pathogenic ANRE epitopes in ELISA binding assays. CSF (3/4) and sera (4/4) from ANRE patients also bound the 293T-ATD cell line, whereas normal CSF and sera did not. CONCLUSIONS: The 293T-ATD cell line is potentially adaptable to a variety of formats to identify antibodies associated with ANRE, including cell-based and soluble antigen formats, and demonstrates a useful method to produce complex proteins for research, drug discovery, and clinical diagnosis.
