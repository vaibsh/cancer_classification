Title: Rapid measurement of hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation by leveraging Bohr effect and Soret band bathochromic shift.
Abstract: Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) binds to hemoglobin (Hb) in the lungs and is then released (dissociated) in the tissues. The Bohr effect is a physiological mechanism that governs the affinity of Hb for O<sub>2</sub> based on pH, where a lower pH results in a lower Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity and higher Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation. Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity and dissociation are crucial for maintaining aerobic metabolism in cells and tissues. Despite its vital role in human physiology, Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement is underutilized in basic research and in clinical laboratories, primarily due to the technical complexity and limited throughput of existing methods. We present a rapid Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement approach by leveraging the Bohr effect and detecting the optical shift in the Soret band that corresponds to the light absorption by the heme group in Hb. This new method reduces Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement time from hours to minutes. We show that Hb deoxygenation can be accelerated chemically at the optimal pH of 6.9. We show that time and pH-controlled deoxygenation of Hb results in rapid and distinct conformational changes in its tertiary structure. These molecular conformational changes are manifested as significant, detectable shifts in Hb's optical absorption spectrum, particularly in the characteristic Soret band (414 nm). We extensively validated the method by testing human blood samples containing normal Hb and Hb variants. We show that rapid Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation can be used to screen for and detect Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity disorders and to evaluate the function and efficacy of Hb-modifying therapies. The ubiquity of optical absorption spectrophotometers positions this approach as an accessible, rapid, and accurate Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement method for basic research and clinical use. We anticipate this method's broad adoption will democratize the diagnosis and prognosis of Hb disorders, such as sickle cell disease. Further, this method has the potential to transform the research and development of new targeted and genome-editing-based therapies that aim to modify or improve Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity.
