Title: Detection of Constitutional Structural Variants by Optical Genome Mapping: A Multisite Study of Postnatal Samples.
Abstract: Optical genome mapping is a high resolution technology that can detect all types of structural variations in the genome. This second phase of a multisite study compares the performance of optical genome mapping and current standard of care methods for diagnostic testing of individuals with constitutional disorders including neurodevelopmental impairments and congenital anomalies. Among the 627 analyses in phase 2, 405 were of retrospective samples supplied by five diagnostic centers in the United States and 94 were prospective samples collected over 18 months by two diagnostic centers (June 2021 - October 2022). Additional samples represented a family cohort to determine inheritance (n=119) and controls (n=9). Full concordance of results between optical genome mapping and one or more standard of care diagnostic tests was 98.6% (618/627) with partial concordance in an additional 1.1% (7/627).
