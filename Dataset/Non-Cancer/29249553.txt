Title: Liver Angiomyolipomas in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-Their Incidence and Course.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology and clinical significance of hepatic angiomyolipomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data from 187 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. The prevalence, progression, and potential relationship between liver lesions and other clinical findings, including genetic associations, were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 187 patients (14.9%) had hepatic lesions. There was a predominance of female over male patients in individuals with liver lesions (17 versus 11), with statistical significance in patients under five years of age (P < 0.05). All individuals having hepatic lesions who also had available genetic testing data (n = 20) were diagnosed with a TSC2 gene mutation. All patients with liver lesions had coexisting renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) (P < 0.05). The age of onset of renal lesions was lower and their prevalence was significantly higher in patients with liver involvement (P < 0.05). In most instances, hepatic lesions measured several millimeters in diameter and were clinically asymptomatic. Progressive lesion growth was documented in six individuals but with no clinical consequences to date. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the association of hepatic lesions with TSC2 mutations, a common origin of liver and renal AMLs, as well as the predominance of female patients in this group. Hepatic AMLs are relatively common but mostly benign lesions.
