Title: Persistent SARS-CoV-2-specific immune defects in kidney transplant recipients following third mRNA vaccine doses.
Abstract: Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) show poorer response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, yet response patterns and mechanistic drivers following third doses are ill-defined. We administered third monovalent mRNA vaccines to n=81 KTRs with negative or low-titer anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody (n=39 anti-RBD<sup>NEG</sup>; n=42 anti-RBD<sup>LO</sup>), compared to healthy controls (HC, n=19), measuring anti-RBD, Omicron neutralization, spike-specific CD8+%, and SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. By day 30, 44% anti-RBD<sup>NEG</sup> remained seronegative; 5% KTRs developed BA.5 neutralization (versus 68% HCs, p<0.001). Day 30 spike-specific CD8+% was negative in 91% KTRs (versus 20% HCs; p=0.07), without correlation to anti-RBD (r<sub>s</sub>=0.17). Day 30 SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCR repertoires were detected in 52% KTRs versus 74% HCs (p=0.11). Spike-specific CD4+ TCR expansion was similar between KTRs and HCs, yet KTR CD8+ TCR depth was 7.6-fold lower (p=0.001). Global negative response was seen in 7% KTRs, associated with high-dose mycophenolate (p=0.037); 44% showed global positive response. 16% KTRs experienced breakthrough infections, with 2 hospitalizations; pre-breakthrough variant neutralization was poor. Absent neutralizing and CD8+ responses in KTRs indicate vulnerability to COVID-19 despite three-dose mRNA vaccination. Lack of neutralization despite CD4<sup>+</sup> expansion suggests B cell dysfunction and/or ineffective T cell help. Development of more effective KTR vaccine strategies is critical.(NCT04969263).
