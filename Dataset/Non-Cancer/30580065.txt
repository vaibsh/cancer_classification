Title: Arteriovenous Fistula Inside Cervical Spinal Canal Associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutation on chromosome 17, which affects the skin, vascular system, nervous system, and skeleton system. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is one of the recognized complications of NF-1. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 33-year-old woman with NF-1 with cervical spine AVF inside the cervical spinal canal who presented with progressive spinal cord compression which was abnormal. After sufficient preparation, the patient underwent vascular embolization, and then symptoms of spinal cord compression significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: This report reminds readers of the possibility of AVF if there is a space-occupying lesion inside the cervical spinal canal and to do computed tomography angiography examination when necessary.
