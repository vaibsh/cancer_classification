Title: Jak2 mutation-positive polycythemia vera presenting as central retinal artery occlusion.
Abstract: PURPOSE: To report the case of a 49-year-old man who presented with profound visual loss in his right eye because of a central retinal artery occlusion, accompanied by a stroke in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery with left upper extremity sequelae. METHODS: The patient underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, fluorescein angiography, thorough neuroophthalmology evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography, 12-lead electrocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiogram, bilateral carotid artery Doppler, Holter monitoring, comprehensive laboratory testing, bone marrow biopsy, and genetic testing. RESULTS: Despite an initially normal hematocrit, the etiology of the central retinal artery occlusion and that of the nearly concomitant stroke in the right medial cerebral artery territory was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy to be polycythemia vera (positive JAK2 mutation). Patient received treatment with aspirin, serial phlebotomies, and hydroxyurea, demonstrating a slight improvement in vision and substantial normalization of neurologic and hematological status. At the time of this report, 2 years later, patient remains stable. CONCLUSION: Central retinal artery occlusion, a disease with a frequently devastating visual outcome, is often not an "isolated" ocular occurrence. In the absence of an obvious local trigger, a thorough work-up is always warranted, especially in younger patients, as the ocular pathology oftentimes may herald severe cerebro-cardiovascular events.
