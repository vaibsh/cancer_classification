Title: The adaptability of the Pulsta valve to the diverse main pulmonary artery shape of native right ventricular outflow tract disease.
Abstract: Pulsta valve is increasingly used for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) in patients with a large native right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). This study aims to elucidate the outcomes of Pulsta valve implantation within the native RVOT and assess its adaptability to various native main pulmonary artery (PA) anatomies.
A multicenter retrospective study included 182 patients with moderate to severe pulmonary regurgitation in the native RVOT who underwent PPVI with Pulsta valves® between February 2016 and August 2023 at five Korean and Taiwanese tertiary referral centers.
Pulsta valve implantation was successful in 179 out of 182 patients (98.4%) with an average age of 26.7 ± 11.0 years. The median follow-up duration was 29 months. Baseline assessments revealed enlarged right ventricle (RV) volume (mean indexed RV end-diastolic volume: 163.1 (interquartile range, IQR: 152.0-180.3 mL/m²), which significantly decreased to 123.6(IQR: 106.6-137.5 mL/m<sup>2</sup>  after 1 year. The main PA types were classified as pyramidal (3.8%), straight (38.5%), reverse pyramidal (13.2%), convex (26.4%), and concave (18.1%) shapes. Pulsta valve placement was adapted, with distal main PA for pyramidal shapes and proximal or mid-PA for reverse pyramidal shapes. Two patients experienced Pulsta valve embolization to RV, requiring surgical removal, and one patient encountered valve migration to the distal main PA, necessitating surgical fixation.
Customized valve insertion sites are pivotal in self-expandable PPVI considering diverse native RVOT shape. The rather soft and compact structure of the Pulsta valve has characteristics to are adaptable to diverse native RVOT geometries.
