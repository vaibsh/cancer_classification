Title: Prospective blinded study of BRAFV600E mutation detection in cell-free DNA of patients with systemic histiocytic disorders.
Abstract: UNLABELLED: Patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) have a high frequency of BRAF(V600E) mutations and respond to RAF inhibitors. However, detection of mutations in tissue biopsies is particularly challenging in histiocytoses due to low tumor content and stromal contamination. We applied a droplet-digital PCR assay for quantitative detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in plasma and urine cell-free (cf) DNA and performed a prospective, blinded study in 30 patients with ECD/LCH. There was 100% concordance between tissue and urinary cfDNA genotype in treatment-naive samples. cfDNA analysis facilitated identification of previously undescribed KRAS(G12S)-mutant ECD and dynamically tracked disease burden in patients treated with a variety of therapies. These results indicate that cfDNA BRAF(V600E) mutational analysis in plasma and urine provides a convenient and reliable method of detecting mutational status and can serve as a noninvasive biomarker to monitor response to therapy in LCH and ECD. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant histiocytic disorders have remarkable responses to RAF inhibition, but mutation detection in tissue in these disorders is challenging. Here, we identify that analysis of plasma and urinary cfDNA provides a reliable method to detect the BRAF(V600E) mutation and monitor response to therapy in these disorders.
