Title: A case of late-onset segmental neurofibromatosis.
Abstract: Segmental neurofibromatosis (NF5) is a rare variant of neurofibromatosis. To our knowledge, there have been few reports of cases presenting later in life. The recognition of NF5 is important, as there have been reports of paraneoplastic manifestations and transmission to offspring. Here we present the case of a patient who presented with NF5 first appearing in her mid-50s. This case illustrates the subtle nature of NF5, which often leads to misdiagnosis.
