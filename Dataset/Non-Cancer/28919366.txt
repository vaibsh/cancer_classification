Title: Prevalence and risk factors for fragility fracture in systemic mastocytosis.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in tissues other than the skin. Bone involvement although frequent has not been thoroughly evaluated. Primary objective was to determine risk factors associated with fragility fractures (FF) in SM. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the ability of bone marrow tryptase (BMT) level to identify patients with FF, and to describe bone involvement in SM. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively all consecutive patients seen in our expert center, with a diagnosis of SM according to the 2001 WHO criteria, and with complete bone assessment. We collected data about lifetime fractures, types of cutaneous manifestations, degranulation symptoms, blood and BMT levels, bone mineral density assessed by densitometry and KIT mutation. We performed a univariate analysis investigating the factors associated with FF and then a logistic multivariable regression analysis. We assessed the ability of bone marrow tryptase to identify patients with FF. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients with SM were included. Thirty-six patients (40.4%) suffered from osteoporosis and twenty-five (28.1%) experienced lifetime FF. Univariate analysis identified age at diagnosis and disease onset, presence of telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans, digestive symptoms, mast cells activation symptoms, elevated BMT, low femoral and lumbar BMD, as associated with FF. Multivariate analysis identified elevated BMT, low femoral T score and older age at diagnosis as independently associated with FF. CONCLUSIONS: Low femoral T-score, BMT level, and older age at diagnosis are markers associated with FF in SM. BMT may represent an important biomarker to predict FF in SM patients.
