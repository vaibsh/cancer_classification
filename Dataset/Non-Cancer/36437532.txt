Title: Novel Genetic Determinants of Dental Maturation in Children.
Abstract: Dental occlusion requires harmonious development of teeth, jaws, and other elements of the craniofacial complex, which are regulated by environmental and genetic factors. We performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on dental development (DD) using the Demirjian radiographic method. Radiographic assessments from participants of the Generation R Study (primary study population, <i>N</i><sub>1</sub> = 2,793; mean age of 9.8 y) were correlated with ~30 million genetic variants while adjusting for age, sex, and genomic principal components (proxy for population stratification). Variants associated with DD at genome-wide significant level (<i>P</i> < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) mapped to 16q12.2 (<i>IRX5</i>) (lead variant rs3922616, <i>B</i> = 0.16; <i>P</i> = 2.2 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). We used Fisher's combined probability tests weighted by sample size to perform a meta-analysis (<i>N</i> = 14,805) combining radiographic DD at a mean age of 9.8 y from Generation R with data from a previous GWAS (<i>N</i><sub>2</sub> = 12,012) on number of teeth (NT) in infants used as proxy of DD at a mean age of 9.8 y (including the ALSPAC and NFBC1966). This GWAS meta-analysis revealed 3 novel loci mapping to 7p15.3 (<i>IGF2BP3: P</i> = 3.2 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), 14q13.3 (<i>PAX9: P</i> = 1.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), and 16q12.2 (<i>IRX5: P</i> = 1.2 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) and validated 8 previously reported NT loci. A polygenic allele score constructed from these 11 loci was associated with radiographic DD in an independent Generation R set of children (<i>N</i> = 703; <i>B</i> = 0.05, <i>P</i> = 0.004). Furthermore, profiling of the identified genes across an atlas of murine and human stem cells observed expression in the cells involved in the formation of bone and/or dental tissues (>0.3 frequency per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads), likely reflecting functional specialization. Our findings provide biological insight into the polygenic architecture of the pediatric dental maturation process.
