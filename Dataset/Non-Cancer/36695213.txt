Title: Toward a realistic in silico abdominal phantom for QSM.
Abstract: QSM outside the brain has recently gained interest, particularly in the abdominal region. However, the absence of reliable ground truths makes difficult to assess reconstruction algorithms, whose quality is already compromised by additional signal contributions from fat, gases, and different kinds of motion. This work presents a realistic in silico phantom for the development, evaluation and comparison of abdominal QSM reconstruction algorithms.
Synthetic susceptibility and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics> <mrow><msubsup><mi>R</mi> <mn>2</mn> <mo>*</mo></msubsup> </mrow> <annotation>$$ {R}_2^{\ast } $$</annotation></semantics> </math> maps were generated by segmenting and postprocessing the abdominal 3T MRI data from a healthy volunteer. Susceptibility and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics> <mrow><msubsup><mi>R</mi> <mn>2</mn> <mo>*</mo></msubsup> </mrow> <annotation>$$ {R}_2^{\ast } $$</annotation></semantics> </math> values in different tissues/organs were assigned according to literature and experimental values and were also provided with realistic textures. The signal was simulated using as input the synthetic QSM and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics> <mrow><msubsup><mi>R</mi> <mn>2</mn> <mo>*</mo></msubsup> </mrow> <annotation>$$ {R}_2^{\ast } $$</annotation></semantics> </math> maps and fat contributions. Three susceptibility scenarios and two acquisition protocols were simulated to compare different reconstruction algorithms.
QSM reconstructions show that the phantom allows to identify the main strengths and limitations of the acquisition approaches and reconstruction algorithms, such as in-phase acquisitions, water-fat separation methods, and QSM dipole inversion algorithms.
The phantom showed its potential as a ground truth to evaluate and compare reconstruction pipelines and algorithms. The publicly available source code, designed in a modular framework, allows users to easily modify the susceptibility, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics> <mrow><msubsup><mi>R</mi> <mn>2</mn> <mo>*</mo></msubsup> </mrow> <annotation>$$ {R}_2^{\ast } $$</annotation></semantics> </math> and TEs, and thus creates different abdominal scenarios.
