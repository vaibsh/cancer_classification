Title: Participation of the E3-ligase TRIM13 in NF-kappaB p65 activation and NFAT-dependent activation of c-Rel upon T-cell receptor engagement.
Abstract: The nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) family members p65 and c-Rel chiefly orchestrate lymphocytes activation following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement. In contrast to p65, which is rapidly mobilized, c-Rel activation occurs subsequently as it involves a nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)-dependent upregulation step. However, how TCR ligation drives p65 and c-Rel activation is not fully understood. Because several ubiquitylated components of NF-kappaB signaling cascade accumulate in close proximity to membranes, we screened a siRNA library against E3-ligases that contain transmembrane domains on TCR-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Here, we report the identification of the endoplasmic reticulum resident TRIM13 protein as an enhancer of NF-kappaB promoter activity. We found that knocking down TRIM13 by RNA interference reduced the activation of p65, while the translocation of c-Rel into the nucleus was blunted. We further observed that c-Rel induction was diminished without TRIM13, as NFAT activation was compromised. These results unveil that TRIM13 is a selective regulator of p65 and of c-Rel activation.
