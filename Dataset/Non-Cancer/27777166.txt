Title: Rathke Cleft Cyst with Evidence of Rupture into Subarachnoid Space.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: A Rathke cleft cyst (RCC) with nonhemorrhagic rupture mimicking pituitary apoplexy has been reported rarely. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with asymptomatic RCC, came to us with a severe headache, along with visual dysfunction and symptoms of pituitary insufficiency. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse hyperintensity in the cerebral cisterns, whereas watery clear cerebrospinal fluid was obtained by lumbar puncture. Surgery performed 1 month after onset revealed a nonhemorrhagic lesion, with a final diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic RCC rupture. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that nonhemorrhagic RCC rupture and subsequent leakage of the contents into subarachnoid space were the underlying pathogenesis in the present case of RCC resembling apoplexy.
