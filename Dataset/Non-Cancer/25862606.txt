Title: Simultaneous assessment of NF-kappaB/p65 phosphorylation and nuclear localization using imaging flow cytometry.
Abstract: Aberrant activity of Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is associated with many diseases and is therapeutically targeted. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation of the RELA/p65 sub-unit, are essential for cytoplasmic to nuclear localization of NF-kappaB/p65 and initiation of transcription of downstream target genes. Immunoblot and phospho-flow cytometry have been used to study the relationship between phosphorylation motifs and NF-kappaB activation and microscopic analysis of nuclear localization of p65 is also used as a parameter for activation. The labor intensive nature of these approaches commonly limits the number of sampling points or replicates. Recent insights into the relationship between p65 phosphorylation motifs and their nuclear localization indicate that these parameters have different significances and should not be used interchangeably. In this study, we demonstrate feasibility and reproducibility of studying the relationship between p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation using imaging flow cytometry (IFC). TNFalpha- or PMA/Ionomycin-induced phosphorylation of p65 at serine 529 in cell line models and healthy donor lymphocytes served as the experimental model. IFC analysis demonstrated that expression of phosphorylated serine 529 (P-p65(s529)) increased rapidly following stimulation and that nuclear localization of P-p65(s529) followed the nuclear localization pattern of total p65. However, in the presence of tacrolimus, P-p65(s529) expression was inhibited without affecting nuclear localization of total p65. The data demonstrate the application of IFC to simultaneously assess phosphorylation of p65 and its cellular localization and the results obtained by this analysis corroborate current insights regarding the specific effect of tacrolimus on serine 529 phosphorylation.
