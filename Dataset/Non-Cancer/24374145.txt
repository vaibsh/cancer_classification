Title: Phase I evaluation of XL019, an oral, potent, and selective JAK2 inhibitor.
Abstract: This phase I study evaluated selective JAK2 inhibitor XL019 in 30 patients with myelofibrosis. The initial dose cohorts were 100, 200, and 300 mg orally on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. Central and/or peripheral neurotoxicity developed in all patients. Subsequently, patients were treated on lower doses; neurotoxicity was again observed, leading to study termination. Peripheral neuropathy resolved in 50%, and central neurotoxicity in all patients within months after therapy cessation. Myelosuppression was minimal. The terminal half-life of XL019 was approximately 21 h, with steady state reached by Day 8. International Working Group defined responses were seen in three (10%) patients.
