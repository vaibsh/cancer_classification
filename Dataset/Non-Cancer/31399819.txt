Title: Use of Mammographic Measurements to Predict Complications After Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy in BRCA Mutation Carriers.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is limited data evaluating mastectomy skin flap complications of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) in patients with BRCA gene mutations. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with post-operative complications in BRCA mutation carriers undergoing NSM. METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, we interrogated a prospectively collected institutional database for patients undergoing NSM who tested positive for BRCA1/2 mutations. Patient characteristics, preoperative details, and complications were evaluated. Digital mammogram was used to estimate the breast volume. RESULTS: From August 2009 to December 2017, 59 patients (2 males) with BRCA1/2 mutations underwent 114 NSMs. Ninety-two (80%) were risk-reduction surgeries. Thirty-two (28%) underwent single-stage reconstruction (24 autologous). The overall complication rate was 26.3% (N = 30), and 10.5% (N = 12) underwent unanticipated reoperation. 8.8% (N = 10) had full-thickness skin flap necrosis, 10.5% (N = 12) nipple necrosis, and 4.4% (N = 5) full-thickness nipple necrosis. These complications were associated with larger breast volume (799.4 cc vs. 544.1 cc, p < 0.001) and greater body mass index (27.8 vs. 24.3, p < 0.001). By univariate analysis, body mass index and breast volume greater than 675 cc were associated with significantly higher complication rate (odds ratios 1.2 and 4.5 respectively, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that NSM in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is associated with complications in one in four patients. Utilizing the preoperative mammograms to estimate breast size may be more helpful than breast cup size in counseling preoperatively the risks of complications.
