Title: Erdheim-Chester disease with an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-avid breast mass and BRAF V600E mutation.
Abstract: Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Herein we report a case of a 49-year-old woman who developed bilateral knee pain. Imaging procedures revealed multiple long bone lesions and a well-defined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-avid mass in the left breast. The breast mass was resected, and an open biopsy was performed on the right femoral lesion. Both specimens revealed involvement by histiocytic infiltrates with features suggestive of ECD. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry.
