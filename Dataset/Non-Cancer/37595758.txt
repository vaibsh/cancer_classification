Title: Gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells restores T cell response in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
Abstract: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a hyperinflammatory disorder characterized by a life-threatening cytokine storm and immunopathology. Familial HLH type 3 (FHL3) accounts for âˆ¼30% of all inborn HLH cases worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the UNC13D gene, which result in impaired degranulation of cytotoxic vesicles and hence compromised T and NK cell-mediated killing. Current treatment protocols, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, still show high mortality.
We sought to develop and evaluate a curative genome editing strategy in the preclinical FHL3 Jinx mouse model. Jinx mice harbor a cryptic splice donor site (cSD) in Unc13d intron 26 and develop clinical symptoms of human FHL3 upon infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).
We employed CRISPR-Cas technology to delete the disease-underlying mutation in HSCs, and transplanted Unc13d-edited stem cells into busulfan-conditioned Jinx recipient mice. Safety studies included extensive genotyping and CAST-Seq based off-target analyses. Cure from HLH predisposition was assessed by LCMV infection.
Hematopoietic cells isolated from transplanted mice revealed efficient gene editing (>95%), polyclonality of the T cell receptor repertoire, and neither signs of off-target effects nor leukemogenesis. Unc13d transcription levels of edited and wildtype cells were comparable. While LCMV challenge resulted in acute HLH in Jinx mice transplanted with mock-edited HSCs, Jinx mice grafted with Unc13d-edited cells showed rapid virus clearance and protection from HLH.
Our study demonstrates that transplantation of CRISPR-Cas edited HSCs supports the development of a functional polyclonal T cell response in the absence of genotoxicity-associated clonal outgrowth.
