Title: Ringed telangiectasias: an unusual presentation of telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans.
Abstract: Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP) is a rare form of cutaneous mastocytosis. While most cutaneous mastocytoses occur in children and are asymptomatic, TMEP occurs predominantly in adults and is associated with systemic manifestations, requiring medical management. TMEP is typically characterised by scattered red-brown macules on the trunk and extremities, but must be differentiated from other telangiectatic conditions such as scleroderma, hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and telangiectasias secondary to cirrhosis. Practitioners must be aware that variants to the classic presentation of TMEP exist, such as the ringed telangiectasias we describe. Diagnostic workup including tissue biopsy must be considered in such patients after a thorough history and physical have been performed and other telangiectatic processes have been ruled out. The treatment of cutaneous mastocytosis aims at controlling symptoms and preventing mast cell degranulation. Cosmetic treatment includes the use ofPsoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, total skin electron beam radiation and flashlamp pulsed-dye laser treatment.
