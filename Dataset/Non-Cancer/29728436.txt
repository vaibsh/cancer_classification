Title: Splenic cyst and its management in a 21-month-old boy: a rare complication of invasive meningococcal disease.
Abstract: Splenic complications of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are well recognised, though cyst formation is rare, particularly in paediatric populations. The best approach to their management is not yet established. This case outlines the management of a splenic cyst in a 21-month-old boy following severe IMD. The case took place in the context of an acute emergence of serogroup W prompting significant media attention and subsequent change in vaccination practice at a jurisdictional level in Australia. The patient was critically unwell early in the illness, then later a collection in the left upper quadrant was detected, shown on ultrasound to be a 11.6x7.7 cm splenic cyst. In this case, the cyst was managed by ultrasound-guided drainage tube insertion. The residual collection was small and stable on subsequent imaging.
