Title: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia post COVID-19 booster vaccination in Brazil: a case series.
Abstract: The emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the administration of different booster vaccines to mitigate COVID-19. Vaccines with adenoviral vectors have been rarely associated with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).
This study aimed to describe 15 cases of VITT after the third and fourth doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil.
Cases were reported after all kinds of anti-SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccinations between October 17, 2021, and September 4, 2022.
Of the 26 suspected cases, 15 cases of VITT were analyzed. Of these, 10 were classified as definite VITT, 2 as probable, 1 as possible, and 2 as unlikely. The estimated frequency of definite, probable, or possible VITT was 0.33 cases per million. Cases were assigned to ChAdOx1 (13 cases), Ad26.COV2.S (1 case), and BNT162b2 (1 case). None of the patients received an adenoviral vaccine as a primary vaccination. The average age of participants was 34 years, and symptoms usually appeared 8 days after vaccination. Headache was the most common symptom, and cerebral veins were the most affected thrombotic site. The overall mortality risk was 53%. Anti-platelet factor 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology was positive in 11 out of 15 patients (73.3%), negative in 2 (13.3%), and missing in 2 (13.3%).
The study confirms that VITT is linked to the first exposure to adenoviral vector vaccines. Since January 2023, Brazil has recommended preferably COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines for individuals aged 18 to 39 years. We suggest that, in the current disease scenario, COVID-19 adenovirus vaccines should not be the first choice for individuals aged <50 years who have not received a previous dose of this type of vaccine.
