Title: Radiogenomics in NF2-Associated Schwannomatosis (Neurofibromatosis Type II): Exploratory Data Analysis.
Abstract: Our pilot study aimed at exploratory radiogenomic data analysis in patients with NF2-associated schwannomatosis (formerly neurofibromatosis type II) to assume the potential of image biomarkers in this pathology. Fifty-three unrelated patients (37 (69.8%) women, avg. age 30.2 Â± 11.2 y.o.) were enrolled in the study. First-order, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), and geometry-based statistics were calculated (3718 features per region of interest). We demonstrated imaging patterns and statistically significant differences in radiomic features potentially related to the genotype and clinical phenotype of the disease. However, the clinical utility of these patterns should be further evaluated. The study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation grant 21-15-00262.
