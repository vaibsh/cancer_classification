Title: The common gamma-chain cytokine receptor: tricks-and-treats for T cells.
Abstract: Originally identified as the third subunit of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex, the common gamma-chain (gammac) also acts as a non-redundant receptor subunit for a series of other cytokines, collectively known as gammac family cytokines. gammac plays essential roles in T cell development and differentiation, so that understanding the molecular basis of its signaling and regulation is a critical issue in T cell immunology. Unlike most other cytokine receptors, gammac is thought to be constitutively expressed and limited in its function to the assembly of high-affinity cytokine receptors. Surprisingly, recent studies reported a series of findings that unseat gammac as a simple housekeeping gene, and unveiled gammac as a new regulatory molecule in T cell activation and differentiation. Cytokine-independent binding of gammac to other cytokine receptor subunits suggested a pre-association model of gammac with proprietary cytokine receptors. Also, identification of a gammac splice isoform revealed expression of soluble gammac proteins (sgammac). sgammac directly interacted with surface IL-2Rbeta to suppress IL-2 signaling and to promote pro-inflammatory Th17 cell differentiation. As a result, endogenously produced sgammac exacerbated autoimmune inflammatory disease, while the removal of endogenous sgammac significantly ameliorated disease outcome. These data provide new insights into the role of both membrane and soluble gammac in cytokine signaling, and open new venues to interfere and modulate gammac signaling during immune activation. These unexpected discoveries further underscore the perspective that gammac biology remains largely uncharted territory that invites further exploration.
