Title: Targeted macrophage phagocytosis by Irg1/itaconate axis improves the prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke and peritonitis.
Abstract: Macrophages are innate immune cells whose phagocytosis function is critical to the prognosis of stroke and peritonitis. cis-aconitic decarboxylase immune-responsive gene 1 (Irg1) and its metabolic product itaconate inhibit bacterial infection, intracellular viral replication, and inflammation in macrophages. Here we explore whether itaconate regulates phagocytosis.
Phagocytosis of macrophages was investigated by time-lapse video recording, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining in macrophage/microglia cultures isolated from mouse tissue. Unbiased RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing assays were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. The effects of Irg1/itaconate axis on the prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH) and peritonitis was observed in transgenic (Irg1<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Cx3cr1<sup>creERT/+</sup>, cKO) mice or control mice in vivo.
In a mouse model of ICH, depletion of Irg1 in macrophage/microglia decreased its phagocytosis of erythrocytes, thereby exacerbating outcomes (n = 10 animals/group, p < 0.05). Administration of sodium itaconate/4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) promoted macrophage phagocytosis (n = 7 animals/group, p < 0.05). In addition, in a mouse model of peritonitis, Irg1 deficiency in macrophages also inhibited phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5 animals/group, p < 0.05) and aggravated outcomes (n = 9 animals/group, p < 0.05). Mechanistically, 4-OI alkylated cysteine 155 on the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), consequent in nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and transcriptional activation of Cd36 gene. Blocking the function of CD36 completely abolished the phagocytosis-promoting effects of Irg1/itaconate axis in vitro and in vivo.
Our findings provide a potential therapeutic target for phagocytosis-deficiency disorders, supporting further development towards clinical application for the benefit of stroke and peritonitis patients.
