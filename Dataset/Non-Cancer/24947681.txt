Title: Anaphylaxis as a clinical manifestation of clonal mast cell disorders.
Abstract: Clonal mast cell disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the presence of gain of function KIT mutations and a constitutively altered activation-associated mast cell immunophenotype frequently associated with clinical manifestations related to the release of mast cells mediators. These disorders do not always fulfil the World Health Organization (WHO)-proposed criteria for mastocytosis, particularly when low-sensitive diagnostic approaches are performed. Anaphylaxis is a frequent presentation of clonal mast cell disorders, particularly in mastocytosis patients without typical skin lesions. The presence of cardiovascular symptoms, e.g., hypotension, occurring after a hymenoptera sting or spontaneously in the absence of cutaneous manifestations such as urticaria is characteristic and differs from the presentation of anaphylaxis in the general population without mastocytosis.
