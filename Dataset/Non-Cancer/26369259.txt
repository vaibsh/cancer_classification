Title: An Adverse Implication of Radiation Therapy for Implant-Retained Maxillofacial Prostheses.
Abstract: We report the 19-year postoperative course of a patient whose maxillary defect was reconstructed with maxillofacial implant-retained facial prostheses. The patient received 60 Gy of radiation therapy. Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy was administered and four 4.0-mm long maxillofacial implants were inserted. Four years and 6 months after insertion surgery, two of the four implants were lost and the others showed bone regression in the surrounding bone. All implants were replaced with Epitec System maxillofacial implants placed in non-irradiated bone. Eleven years and 6 months after replacement, the Epitec System has been maintaining good and firm osseointegration. Appropriate selection of implant sites and no history of radiation therapy are keys to successful implant reconstruction. However, adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy is believed to be effective, osseointegrated implant should be inserted at a point appropriately distant from an irradiated lesion.
