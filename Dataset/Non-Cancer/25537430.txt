Title: 4D co-registration of X-ray and MR-mammograms: initial clinical results and potential incremental diagnostic value.
Abstract: PURPOSE: 4D co-registration of X-ray- and MR-mammograms (XM and MM) is a new method of image fusion. The present study aims to evaluate its clinical feasibility, radiological accuracy, and potential clinical value. METHODS: XM and MM of 25 patients were co-registered. Results were evaluated by a blinded reader. RESULTS: Precision of the 4D co-registration was "very good" (mean-score [ms]=7), and lesions were "easier to delineate" (ms=5). In 88.8%, "relevant additional diagnostic information" was present, accounting for a more "confident diagnosis" in 76% (ms=5). CONCLUSION: 4D co-registration is feasible, accurate, and of potential clinical value.
