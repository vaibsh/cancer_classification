Title: Prediction of mortality and overt hepatic encephalopathy undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: a retrospective cohort study.
Abstract: Data on medium- and long-term efficacy and safety of Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) using Viatorr stents in Chinese patients are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the 5-year mortality and the incidence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) after Viatorr stent insertion, and construct a model to predict post-TIPS OHE preoperatively.
One hundred thirty-two patients undergoing Viatorr stent insertion in our institution between August 2016 and December 2019 were included, and randomly divided into training and validation cohort at a 70/30 ratio. Patients were followed up until death or the end date of follow-up (December 31st, 2021). The primary end point was all-cause mortality, and the secondary end points were OHE, variceal rebleeding, recurrent ascites and shunt dysfunction.
The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 92.4%, 87.9%, 85.3%, 80.2% and 80.2%, respectively. Post-TIPS OHE and Child-Pugh grade were independent prognostic factors. The rates of variceal rebleeding, recurrent ascites, shunt dysfunction and post-TIPS OHE were 9.1%, 14.3%, 5.3% and 28.0%, respectively. The variables of nomogram predicting post-TIPS OHE included age, diabetes and ascites grade. The area under time-dependent receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) in training and validation cohort were 0.806 and 0.751, respectively. The decision curve analysis (DCA) showed good net benefit both in training and validation cohort.
Post-TIPS OHE and Child-Pugh grade are independent prognostic factors for early mortality in cirrhosis patients, thus we construct a simple and convenient prediction model for post-TIPS OHE to identify high-risk patients preoperatively.
