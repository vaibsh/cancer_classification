Title: Contribution of Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 Genotypes to Taiwan Pterygium Risk.
Abstract: In the literature, the studies about the role of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in pterygium diagnosis are mainly based on its protein expression. The role of MMP-2 variants has never been examined. The aim of this study was to examine the association of MMP-2 genotypes with pterygium risk.
MMP-2 rs243865 and rs2285053 were genotyped in 140 pterygium cases and 280 non-pterygium controls by typical polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) genotyping technology.
The genotypic frequency of MMP-2 rs243865 CC, CT and TT were 86.4%, 12.9% and 0.7% in the pterygium group and 81.1%, 17.1% and 1.8% in the non-pterygium group (p for trend=0.3389). The variant CT and TT carriers had a 0.70- and 0.38-fold pterygium risk (95%CI=0.39-1.26 and 0.04-3.25, p=0.2982 and 0.6686, respectively). As for MMP-2 rs2285053, the genotypic frequency of CC, CT and TT were 67.1%, 28.6% and 4.3% in the pterygium group, non-significantly different from those in non-pterygium group (p for trend=0.7081). The CT and TT carriers had a 0.88- and 0.71-fold pterygium risk (95%CI=0.56-1.38 and 0.27-1.88, p=0.6612 and 0.6456, respectively). The allelic analysis results showed that MMP-2 rs243865 variant T allele was not associated with pterygium risk (7.1% versus 10.4%, OR=0.67, 95%CI=0.39-1.13, p=0.1649). As for MMP-2 rs2285053, the T allele was not associated with pterygium risk either (18.6% versus 21.1%, OR=0.85, 95%CI=0.59-1.23, p=0.4136).
The genotypes at MMP-2 rs243865 or rs2285053 played minor role in determining individual susceptibility for pterygium among Taiwanese.
