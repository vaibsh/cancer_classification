Title: MutSbeta promotes trinucleotide repeat expansion by recruiting DNA polymerase beta to nascent (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins for error-prone DNA synthesis.
Abstract: Expansion of (CAG) (CTG) repeats causes a number of familial neurodegenerative disorders. Although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, components involved in DNA mismatch repair, particularly mismatch recognition protein MutSbeta (a MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), are implicated in (CAG) (CTG) repeat expansion. In addition to recognizing small insertion-deletion loop-outs, MutSbeta also specifically binds DNA hairpin imperfect heteroduplexes formed within (CAG)n (CTG)n sequences. However, whether or not and how MutSbeta binding triggers expansion of (CAG) (CTG) repeats remain unknown. We show here that purified recombinant MutSbeta physically interacts with DNA polymerase beta (Polbeta) and stimulates Polbeta-catalyzed (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpin retention. Consistent with these in vitro observations, MutSbeta and Polbeta interact with each other in vivo, and colocalize at (CAG) (CTG) repeats during DNA replication. Our data support a model for error-prone processing of (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins by MutSbeta and Polbeta during DNA replication and/or repair: MutSbeta recognizes (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins formed in the nascent DNA strand, and recruits Polbeta to the complex, which then utilizes the hairpin as a primer for extension, leading to (CAG) (CTG) repeat expansion. This study provides a novel mechanism for trinucleotide repeat expansion in both dividing and non-dividing cells.
