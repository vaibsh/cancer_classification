Title: Myelofibrosis Treatment Algorithm 2018.
Abstract: Two novel prognostic systems for primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were recently unveiled: GIPSS (genetically inspired prognostic scoring system) and MIPSS70 (mutation-enhanced international prognostic scoring system for transplant-age patients). GIPSS is based exclusively on genetic markers: mutations and karyotype. MIPSS70 includes mutations and clinical risk factors. In its most recent adaptation, the prognostic value of MIPSS70 has been bolstered by the inclusion of a three-tiered cytogenetic risk stratification and use of hemoglobin thresholds that are adjusted for sex and severity (MIPSS70+ version 2.0). GIPSS features four, MIPSS70 three, and MIPSS70+ version 2.0 five risk categories. MIPSS70 is most useful in the absence of cytogenetic information. MIPSS70+ version 2.0 is more comprehensive than MIPSS70 and is the preferred model in the presence of cytogenetic information. Both MIPSS70 and MIPSS70+ version 2.0 require an online score calculator ( http://www.mipss70score.it ). GIPPS offers a lower complexity prognostic tool that reliably identifies candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplant (GIPSS high-risk disease) or long-term observation with little or no therapeutic intervention (GIPSS low-risk disease). Ultimately, we favor a step-wise prognostication approach that starts with GIPSS but also considers MIPSS70+ version 2.0 for confirming the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient.
