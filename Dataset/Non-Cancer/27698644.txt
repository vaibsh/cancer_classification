Title: Proximal Interphalangeal Joint Fibromatosis After Pyrocarbon Implant Insertion: A Case Report.
Abstract: Background: Pyrocarbon implants represent an increasingly popular method to treat proximal interphalangeal joint dysfunction. To this point, no association has been shown between pyrocarbon biomaterials and fibromatosis. We present a potentially serious and destructive complication associated with pyrocarbon arthroplasty. Methods: We demonstrate a clinical case involving pyrocarbon arthroplasty and subsequent fibromatosis development in an otherwise healthy 23-year-old female. To present this association, we illustrate the diagnostic workup involved in a rapidly expanding soft tissue mass of the hand and explain the appropriate treatment. Results: Pyrocarbon arthroplasty was associated with development of locally destructive fibromatosis confirmed by histopathological examination. Treatment involved wide resection with preservation of local structures. Conclusion: We describe the first association between fibromatosis and pyrocarbon biomaterial. Due to fibromatosis destructive effects, clinicians should be aware of potential complications associated with these materials and know how to accurately diagnose and treat these lesions.
