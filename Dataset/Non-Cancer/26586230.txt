Title: Diverse Cutaneous Presentations of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in Children: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease, frequently affecting young children. PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective study in patients younger than 16 years old manifesting with skin symptoms, and documented their different cutaneous lesions and systemic symptoms. We compared subgroups of children with single-system, skin-only, and multisystem disease and sought signs predictive for multisystem disease. In a small sample of patients, BRAF mutations were analyzed in archived biopsies. RESULTS: A wide spectrum of cutaneous presentations varying from crusted nodules and papules, blisters, vascular tumor-like lesions, scaling orange to red macules (frequently in seborrheic regions) to purpuric macules, and papules was documented in our cohort of 32 children. Otitis externa was a common manifestation and mucosal lesions were seen in three patients. A novel manifestation was a red-blue nodule that appeared in a patient after a vaccination. None of the cutaneous lesions was predictive for the classification or final outcome as a single-system or multisystem disease. However, later onset and a more protracted course of skin lesions were more frequent findings in multisystem LCH. Mucosal lesions and otitis externa were almost exclusively seen in patients with multisystem disease, a finding that warrants further investigation. Both wild-type (WT) and mutated BRAF were found not only in multisystem LCH, but also in skin-only LCH. Two cases with rapidly resolving congenital lesions had WT BRAF. CONCLUSIONS: Late onset and a protracted course of skin lesions are associated with MS-LCH, whereas WT BRAF is found in rapidly resolving skin lesions.
