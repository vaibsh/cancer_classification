Title: [A case of growth hormone deficiency combined with neurofibromatosis Type 1 and its gene analysis].
Abstract: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by NF1 gene mutations. Cafe au lait spots, neurofibromatosis, Lisch nodules, axillary freckling, dermal neurofibromas and skeletal dysplasia are the most common manifestations for this disease. A 11-year-old boy visited Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University due to growth-retardation. He was eventually diagnosed as NF1 with growth hormone deficiency. A novel heterozygous splicing mutation c.6579+2 T>C (IVS 34+2 T>C) of NF1 gene was identified in the patient and his mother. Considering NF1 may present with short stature due to growth hormone deficiency, all children with short stature combined with cafe au lait spots should be screened for NF1, which may assist the clinical diagnosis and the genetic counseling.
