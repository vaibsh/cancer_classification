Title: Characterization of New Alpha Zero (α<sup>0</sup>) Thalassaemia Deletion (--<sup>GB</sup>) among Malays in Malaysian Population.
Abstract: Malaysia is a multicultural and multiethnic country comprising numerous ethnic groups. From the total population of 32.7 million, Malays form the bulk of the Bumiputera in Malaysia comprise about 69.9%, followed by Chinese 22.8%, Indian 6.6%, and others 0.7%. The heterogeneous population and increasing numbers of non-citizens in this country affects the heterogeneity of genetic diseases, diversity, and heterogeneity of thalassaemia mutations. Alpha (α)-thalassaemia is an inherited haemoglobin disorder characterized by hypochromic microcytic anaemia caused by a quantitative reduction in the α-globin chain. A majority of the α-thalassaemia are caused by deletions in the α-globin gene cluster. Among Malays, the most common deletional alpha thalassaemia is -α<sup>3.7</sup> deletion followed by --<sup>SEA</sup> deletion. We described the molecular characterization of a new --<sup>GB</sup> deletion in our population, involving both alpha genes in <i>cis</i>. Interestingly, we found that this mutation is unique among Malay ethnicities. It is important to diagnose this deletion because of the 25% risk of Hb Bart's with hydrops fetalis in the offspring when in combination with another α<sup>0</sup>- thalassaemia allele. MLPA is a suitable method to detect unknown and uncommon deletions and to characterize those cases which remain unresolved after a standard diagnostic approach.
