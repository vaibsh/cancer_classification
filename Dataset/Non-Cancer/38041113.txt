Title: Development of a neutralization monoclonal antibody with a broad neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Abstract: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants has challenged the effectiveness of current therapeutic regimens. Here, we aimed to develop a potent SARS-CoV-2 antibody with broad neutralizing effect by screening a scFv library with the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) via phage display.
SKAI-DS84 was identified through phage display, and we performed pseudovirus neutralization assays, authentic virus neutralization assays, and in vivo neutralization efficacy evaluations. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was conducted to assess the physical characteristics of the antibody, including binding kinetics and measure its affinity for variant RBDs.
The selected clones were converted to human IgG, and among them, SKAI-DS84 was selected for further analyses based on its binding affinity with the variant RBDs. Using pseudoviruses, we confirmed that SKAI-DS84 was strongly neutralizing against wild-type, B.1.617.2, B.1.1.529, and subvariants of SARS-CoV-2. We also tested the neutralizing effect of SKAI-DS84 on authentic viruses, in vivo and observed a reduction in viral replication and improved lung pathology. We performed binding and epitope mapping experiments to understand the mechanisms underlying neutralization and identified quaternary epitopes formed by the interaction between RBDs as the target of SKAI-DS84.
We identified, produced, and tested the neutralizing effect of SKAI-DS84 antibody. Our results highlight that SKAI-DS84 could be a potential neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.
