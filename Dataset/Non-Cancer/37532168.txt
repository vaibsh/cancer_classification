Comparison of pregnancies resulting from embryos classified as euploid or mosaic using the 20%-80% interval in chromosomal intermediate copy numbers to define a mosaic result.
Rates of spontaneous abortion, birth weight, length of gestation, incidence of birth defects, and chromosomal status during gestation.
Implanted euploid embryos had a significantly lower risk of spontaneous abortion compared with mosaic embryos (8.9% [n = 8,672; 95% confidence interval {CI95} 8.3, 9.5] vs. 22.2% [n = 914; CI95 19.6, 25.0]). Embryos with mosaicism affecting whole chromosomes (not segmental) had the highest risk of spontaneous abortion (27.6% [n = 395; CI95 23.2, 32.3]). Infants born from euploid, mosaic, and whole chromosome mosaic embryos had average birth weights and lengths of gestation that were not statistically different (3,118 g and 267 days [n = 488; CI95 3,067, 3,169, and 266, 268], 3052 g and 265 days [n = 488; CI95 2,993, 3,112, and 264,267], 3,159 g and 268 days [n = 194; CI95 3,070, 3,249, and 266,270], respectively). Out of 488 infants from mosaic embryo transfers (ETs), one had overt gross abnormalities as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most prenatal tests performed on pregnancies from mosaic ETs had normal results, and only three pregnancies produced prenatal test results reflecting the mosaicism detected at the embryonic stage (3 out of 250, 1.2%; CI95 0.25, 3.5).
Although embryos classified as mosaic experience higher rates of miscarriage than euploid embryos (with a particularly high frequency shortly after implantation), infants born of mosaic ETs are similar to infants of euploid ETs. Prenatal testing indicates that mosaicism resolves during most pregnancies, although this process is not perfectly efficient. In a small percentage of cases, the mosaicism persists through gestation. These findings can serve as risk-benefit considerations for mosaic ETs in the fertility clinic.
