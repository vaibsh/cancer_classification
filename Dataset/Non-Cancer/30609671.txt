Title: Development of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ and [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO: Novel Tirapazamine (TPZ)-Based Radioiodinated Pharmaceuticals for Application in Theranostic Management of Hypoxia.
Abstract: Introduction: Benzotriazine-1,4-dioxides (BTDOs) such as tirapazamine (TPZ) and its derivatives act as radiosensitizers of hypoxic tissues. The benzotriazine-1-monoxide (BTMO) metabolite (SR 4317, TPZMO) of TPZ also has radiosensitizing properties, and via unknown mechanisms, is a potent enhancer of the radiosensitizing effects of TPZ. Unlike their 2-nitroimidazole radiosensitizer counterparts, radiolabeled benzotriazine oxides have not been used as radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic imaging or molecular radiotherapy (MRT) of hypoxia. The radioiodination chemistry for preparing model radioiodinated BTDOs and BTMOs is now reported. Hypothesis: Radioiodinated 3-(2-iodoethoxyethyl)-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide (I-EOE-TPZ), a novel bioisosteric analogue of TPZ, and 3-(2-iodoethoxyethyl)-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1-oxide (I-EOE-TPZMO), its monoxide analogue, are candidates for in vivo and in vitro investigations of biochemical mechanisms in pathologies that develop hypoxic microenvironments. In theory, both radiotracers can be prepared from the same precursors. Methods: Radioiodination procedures were based on classical nucleophilic [131I]iodide substitution on Tos-EOE-TPZ (P1) and by [131I]iodide exchange on I-EOE-TPZ (P2). Reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, solvent and the influence of pivalic acid on products' formation and the corresponding radiochemical yields (RCY) were investigated. Results: The [131I]iodide labeling reactions invariably led to the synthesis of both products, but with careful manipulation of conditions the preferred product could be recovered as the major product. Radioiodide exchange on P2 in ACN at 80 +- 5  C for 30 min afforded the highest RCY, 89%, of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ, which upon solid phase purification on an alumina cartridge gave 60% yield of the product with over 97% of radiochemical purity. Similarly, radioiodide exchange on P2 in ACN at 50 +- 5  C for 30 min with pivalic acid afforded the highest yield, 92%, of [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO exclusively with no trace of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ. In both cases, extended reaction times and/or elevated temperatures resulted in the formation of at least two additional radioactive reaction products. Conclusions: Radioiodination of P1 and P2 with [131I]iodide leads to the facile formation of [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO. At 80  C and short reaction times, the facile reduction of the N-4-oxide moiety was minimized to afford acceptable radiochemical yields of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ from either precursor. Regeneration of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ from [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO is impractical after reaction work-up.
