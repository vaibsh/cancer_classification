Title: Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia: clinical and molecular review.
Abstract: Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (HED) is a genetic human disorder which affects structures of ectodermal origin. Although there are autosomal recessive and dominant forms, X-linked (XL) is the most frequent form of the disease. This XL-HED phenotype is associated with mutations in the gene encoding the transmembrane protein ectodysplasin-1 (EDA1), a member of the TNFalpha-related signaling pathway. The proteins from this pathway are involved in signal transduction from ectoderm to mesenchyme leading to the development of ectoderm-derived structures in the fetus such as hair, teeth, skin, nails, and eccrine sweat glands. The aim of this review was to update the main clinical characteristics of HED regarding to recent molecular advances in the comprehension of all the possible genes involved in this group of disorders since it is known that Eda-A1-Edar signaling has multiple roles in ectodermal organ development, regulating their initiation, morphogenesis, and differentiation steps. The knowledge of the biological mechanisms that generate HED is needed for both a better detection of possible cases and for the design of efficient prevention and treatment approaches.
