Title: Expression analysis of microRNA-125 in patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia and correlation with JAK2 allele burden and laboratory findings.
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The JAK2V617F mutation has emerged in recent years as a diagnostic as well as a treatment target in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The disease phenotype is also influenced by other factors such as microRNA (miRNA) deregulation. The aim of this study was to investigate miR-125 expression level in these patients with those obtained from healthy control subjects and its correlation with JAK2 allele burden and laboratory findings. METHODS: In total, forty patients with a clinical diagnosis of PV and ET were examined at the time of diagnosis. Ten healthy subjects were checked as controls. We performed JAK2 V617F allele burdens measurement and expression analysis of miR-125b-5p, miR-125b-3p, miR-125a-5p, and miR-125a-3p in leukocytes isolated from peripheral blood by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: MiR-125b-5p and miR-125a-5p were upregulated in both patients with PV (P = 0.00 and P = 0.003, respectively) and ET (P = 0.02 and P = 0.002, respectively). In PV group, a significant correlation was observed between miR-125a-5p and platelet counts (P = 0.01, r = 0.531). The correlation between miRNA and JAk2 allele burden was not significant. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data indicate that other factors such as aberrant miR-125 expression may influence on the disease phenotype in patients with PV and ET.
