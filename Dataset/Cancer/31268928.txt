Title: Melanotic Schwannoma of the Vulva: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
Abstract: Melanotic schwannoma is a pigmented tumor of peripheral nerve differentiation. Primary cutaneous presentations are extremely rare, as the bulk of melanotic schwannomas tend to develop in paraspinal and axial sites. Tumors arise sporadically and in the setting of the Carney complex. Alterations in the gene encoding protein kinase A regulatory subunit-alpha (PRKAR1A) underlie most patients with the Carney complex and mediate melanotic schwannoma tumorigenesis. Melanotic schwannomas from noncutaneous sites can locally recur and metastasize widely, leading to a recent proposal to change the nomenclature to "malignant melanotic schwannian tumor." However, the clinicopathologic features of primary cutaneous melanotic schwannomas are relatively unexplored. We present a case of a nodule arising on the vulva of a 34-year-old woman. Microscopically, a dermal-based, heavily pigmented proliferation of plump spindled and epithelioid cells arrayed in nodules and fascicles was seen. Lesional cells stained positively for S100, Melan-A, and BAP1 but were negative for Prkar1alpha. Next-generation sequencing of a panel of 480 cancer-associated genes revealed that the tumor harbored a PRKAR1A p.S299fs truncating mutation and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 17q, the locus at which PRKAR1A resides. Importantly, no other genetic abnormalities or chromosomal copy number changes were identified. On the basis of combined histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features, a diagnosis of melanotic schwannoma was rendered. Overall, we present the first clinicopathologic description of a vulvar melanotic schwannoma, review the literature concerning cutaneous presentations of melanotic schwannoma, and propose that melanotic schwannian tumors native to skin may behave more indolently than their noncutaneous counterparts.
