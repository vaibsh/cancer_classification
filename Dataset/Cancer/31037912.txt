Title: [Galectin-3 Expression and Its Clinical Significance in Acute Myeloid Leukemia with Positive AML1/ETO Fusion Gene].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mRNA expression of galectin-3 and its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients carrying AML1/ETOfusion gene. METHODS: RQ-PCR method was used to detect the expression of galectin-3 mRNA in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 53 AML patients with AML1/ETO+, ELISA was used to detect the expression of galectin-3 protein in peripheral blood, and the correlations of galectin-3 expression with clinical and laboratory features and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of galectin-3 were significantly higher in newly diagnosed AML1/ETO+ AML patients compared with the control ( P<0.001). Galectin-3 mRNA and protein expressions were positively correlated (r=0.732, P<0.001). Galectin-3 protein was significantly decreased during the period of complete remission (CR)( P<0.001). The mRNA expression of galectin-3 was negatively correlated with the count of white blood cells ( P=0.014), and positively correlated with CD34 expression and additional cytogenetic aberrations (ACA) ( P=0.001, P=0.026). There was no significant difference in CR, partial remission (PR), induction death (early mortality) between galectin-3 high-expression group and low-expression group ( P>0.05), but there was significant difference in recurrence rate between the two groups ( P=0.029). The median overall survival (OS) rate and disease-free survival (DFS) rate were shortened in the high-expression group ( P=0.007, P=0.015) and the cumulative incidence of relapse was increased ( P=0.045), but there was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of CM(155mm]mortality ( P>0.05). Cox regression analysis suggested galectin-3 mRNA level an independent indicator of OS and DFS in AML1/ETO+ AML patients. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow galectin-3 mRNA level may be an important reference index for evaluating the prognosis and guiding the treatment of AML1/ETO+ AML patients.
