Title: Liquid biopsy tracking of lung tumor evolutions over time.
Abstract: Introduction: The rise of the personalized era in lung cancer prompted the evaluation of novel diagnostic tools to overcome some of the limits of traditional tumor genotyping. Liquid biopsy refers to a multitude of minimally invasive techniques that can allow a real-time biomolecular characterization of the tumor through the analysis of human body fluids.Areas covered: Herein we provide a comprehensive overview of the role of liquid biopsy in lung cancer, mainly focusing on the most studied members of the liquid biopsy family, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs).Expert opinion: Among the different components of the large liquid biopsy family, cfDNA is the most studied and widely adopted source for tumor genotyping in lung cancer, already entered clinical practice for detection of both sensitizing and resistance EGFR mutations. However, the impressive technological advances made in the last few years are expanding its potential applications, allowing a more comprehensive plasma genotyping through next-generation sequencing and moving from advanced/metastatic disease to novel frontiers, such as early detection and minimal residual disease evaluation.
