Title: Concurrent Driver Gene Mutations as Negative Predictive Factors in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are clinically effective in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncogene mutations. Genetic factors, other than EGFR sensitive mutations, that allow prognosis of TKI treatment remain undefined. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 423 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR 19del or 21L858R mutations. A total of 71 patients whose progression-free survivals (PFS) were shorter than 6 months or longer than 24 months were included and stratified into separate groups. Genetic background discrepancy was analysed in the two groups using next generation sequencing (NGS). FINDINGS: Sensitive EGFR mutations of 19del or 21L858R were detected by NGS in all patients; the 21L858R mutation was the major type. The most frequent accompanying somatic mutations were TP53, RB1, MAP2K. ALK fusion, MET amplification, and BRAF V600E were found only in the short PFS group. Concurrent pretreament T790 M mutation was found in both groups, but was proportionally higher in the short PFS group. In the short PFS group, patients had significantly more driver gene mutations than in long PFS group (P = 0 018). The numbers of concomitant somatic mutations, EGFR pathway-related mutations, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) were not significantly different between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Co-occuring driver gene mutations were negative predictive factors of TKI therapy in EGFR-mutated patients. This study highlights the importance of exploring co-occuring genomic alterations before initiation of EGFR-TKIs.
