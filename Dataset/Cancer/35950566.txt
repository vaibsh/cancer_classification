Title: LIBRETTO-432, a phase III study of adjuvant selpercatinib or placebo in stage IB-IIIA <i>RET</i> fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.
Abstract: Selpercatinib, a first-in-class, highly selective and potent central nervous system-active RET kinase inhibitor demonstrated clinically meaningful activity with manageable toxicity in pretreated and treatment-naive advanced/metastatic <i>RET</i> fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LIBRETTO-432 is a global, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial evaluating selpercatinib versus placebo in stage IB-IIIA, <i>RET</i> fusion-positive NSCLC, previously treated with definitive surgery or radiation; participants must have undergone available anti-cancer therapy (including chemotherapy or durvalumab) or not be suitable for it, per investigator's discretion. The primary end point is investigator-assessed event-free survival (EFS) in the primary analysis population (stage II-IIIA <i>RET</i> fusion-positive NSCLC). Key secondary end points include EFS in the overall population, overall survival, and time to distant disease recurrence in the central nervous system.
