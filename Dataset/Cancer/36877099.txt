Title: TRUST-II: a global phase II study of taletrectinib in <i>ROS1</i>-positive non-small-cell lung cancer and other solid tumors.
Abstract: Crizotinib and entrectinib have been approved to treat <i>ROS1</i> fusion-positive (ROS1<sup>+</sup>) non-small-cell lung cancer. However, unmet needs remain, including treatment of patients with resistance mutations, efficacy in brain metastasis and avoidance of neurological side effects. Taletrectinib was designed to: improve efficacy; overcome resistance to first-generation ROS1 inhibitors; and address brain metastasis while conferring fewer neurological adverse events. All of these features are demonstrated and supported by the interim data from the regional phase II TRUST-I clinical study. Here we describe the rationale and design of TRUST-II, a global phase II study of taletrectinib in patients with locally advanced/metastatic ROS1<sup>+</sup> non-small-cell lung cancer and other ROS1<sup>+</sup> solid tumors. The primary end point is confirmed objective response rate. Secondary end points include duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety. This trial is enrolling patients in North America, Europe and Asia.
