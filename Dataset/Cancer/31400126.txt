Title: [The value of detecting MLL gene rearrangement in children with acute monocytic leukemia].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of detecting the rearrangement of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene in children with acute mononuclear leukemia (AML). METHODS: Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe was used to detect MLL gene rearrangement in 68 children with AML by interphase FISH. The results were compared with that of conventional G banding chromosomal analysis. RESULTS: Among the 68 children, 28 were detected by FISH with positive hybridization signals, with a detection rate for MLL gene rearrangement being 41.2%. Twelve (17.6%) reciprocal translocations and interruption of 11q23 were detected by G banding analysis. The difference in the detection rates between the two methods was statistically significant (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of FISH assay for MLL gene rearrangement was significantly higher than that of G banding chromosomal karyotyping. Combined use of both methods for children with AML can improve the detection rate of MLL gene rearrangements and provide crucial clues for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
