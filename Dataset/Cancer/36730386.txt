Title: Atypical Molecular Features of Pediatric Tectal Glioma: A Single Institutional Series.
Abstract: We present 4 children (diagnosed between 1 and 8Â y, 3 females and 1 male) with molecularly distinct tectal gliomas (2 KRAS mutant, 1 EGFR mutant, 1 SRGAP3-RAF-1 fusion) that contributes to the growing literature of this uncommonly biopsied tumor. The patient with EGFR R222C mutation had a more severe course, earlier diagnosis, subsequent leptomeningeal metastatic disease, required more aggressive therapies, and died 9 years after diagnosis. Patients with KRAS mutations and SRGAP3-RAF-1 fusion had a more indolent course. Our series expands the molecular phenotype of tectal glioma with the potential for leptomeningeal dissemination. Future studies on establishing genotypic/phenotypic correlation from those who undergo biopsy are needed.
