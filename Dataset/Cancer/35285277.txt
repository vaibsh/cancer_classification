Title: Single agent VS-6766 or VS-6766 plus defactinib in <i>KRAS</i>-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer: the RAMP-202 phase II trial.
Abstract: <i>KRAS</i> mutations occur in approximately 30% of lung adenocarcinomas, mainly in codon 12 (83% of cases), p.G12C being the prevalent one (40%), followed by p.G12V and p.G12D (22Â and 16%, respectively). Treatment options for advanced <i>KRAS</i> mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (<i>KRAS</i>-MT NSCLC) are limited to chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). However, clinical trials exploring specific targeted agents are expected to change the treatment landscape of this disease. Here, we describe the design and scientific rationale of the randomized, phase II, open label, RAMP-202 study, which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of VS-6766 versus VS-6766 in combination with defactinib in advanced <i>KRAS</i>-MT NSCLC patients after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy and CPI.
