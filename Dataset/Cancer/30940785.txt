Title: [A Case of Meningeal Solitary Fibrous Tumour/Haemangiopericytoma WHO Grade III Metastasized to the Spleen Shortly After Tumor Resection].
Abstract: Revision of WHO guidelines in 2016 led to the classification of solitary fibrous tumours(SFTs)and haemangiopericytomas(HPCs)as a single tumor entity characterized by NAB2-STAT6 fusion. Standard-of-care treatment involves surgery, but local recurrence and distant metastasis sometimes occur. The average latency to metastasis after surgery is 99 months. A 38-year-old female patient presented with a complaint of headache. An 8x5x2cm lesion showing Gd-T1 enhancement was detected near the superior sagittal sinus. Pathological assessment following resection revealed proliferating, polymorphic, atypical tumor cells with distinct nucleoli in a "patternless pattern." Cellularity was moderate to high, and mitotic figures were observed in 15/10 high power fields. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells tested positive for STAT6, and RT-PCR revealed a NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene(exons 6 and 17, respectively), supporting a diagnosis of SFT/HPC WHO grade III. Despite postoperative radiotherapy, multiple metastases to the spleen were detected 8 months after surgery, and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The pathology of the splenic tumor was similar to that of the intracranial tumor. Recurrent disease in a lymph node was detected 1 month later, and local radiation therapy was administered. The patient died of cancerous peritonitis 5 months later. In this case, exceedingly rapid metastasis to the spleen occurred, despite the administration of vigorous treatment. Here, we review SFT/HPC incidence, treatment, and outcomes to better understand this rare malignancy.
