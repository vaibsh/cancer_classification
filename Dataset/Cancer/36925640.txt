Title: Construction of anoikis-related lncRNAs risk model: Predicts prognosis and immunotherapy response for gastric adenocarcinoma patients.
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Anoikis acts as a programmed cell death that is activated during carcinogenesis to remove undetected cells isolated from ECM. Further anoikis based risk stratification is expected to provide a deeper understanding of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) carcinogenesis. <b>Methods:</b> The information of STAD patients were acquired from TCGA dataset. Anoikis-related genes were obtained from the Molecular Signatures Database and Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the anoikis-related lncRNAs (ARLs). We performed machine learning algorithms, including Univariate Cox regression and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) analyses on the ARLs to build the OS-score and OS-signature. Clinical subgroup analysis, tumor mutation burden (TMB) detection, drug susceptibility analysis, immune infiltration and pathway enrichment analysis were further performed to comprehensive explore the clinical significance. <b>Results:</b> We established a STAD prognostic model based on five ARLs and its prognostic value was verified. Survival analysis showed that the overall survival of high-risk score patients was significantly shorter than that of low-risk score patients. The column diagrams show satisfactory discrimination and calibration. The calibration curve verifies the good agreement between the prediction of the line graph and the actual observation. TIDE analysis and drug sensitivity analysis showed significant differences between different risk groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> The novel prognostic model based on anoikis-related lncRNAs we identified could be used for prognosis prediction and precise therapy in gastric adenocarcinoma.
