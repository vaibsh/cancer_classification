Title: [Expression of WT1 gene and its prognostic value in patients with acute myeloid leukemia].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of Wilms'tumor 1 (WT1) gene in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and to explore its application in predicting prognosis of AML in patients with wild or mutated nucleophosmin 1(NPM1) and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). METHODS: One hundred and sixty-seven newly diagnosed AML patients(exclued M3 type) were enrolled in this study. The survival of patients were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method. The clinical data, laboratory findings and the survival of patients were analyzed and compared between patients with high WT1 expression (high-WT1 group) and those with low WT1 expression (low-WT1 group), as well as among the patients with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD wild type and mutants. RESULTS: The overall response rates (ORR) in high-WT1 and low-WT1 groups were 65.9% (83/126) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (P<0.01). Compared with the low-WT1 group, the high-WT1 group had lower 2-y overall survival (OS) rate (46.1% vs. 75.2%, P<0.05) and 2-y disease free survival (DFS) rate (43.5% vs. 68.5%, P<0.05). After induction chemotherapy, the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >= 1log was associated with higher ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), but the advantage of 2-y DFS rate was not shown (P>0.05). In patients with NPM1 wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), while in the patients with FLT3-ITD wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR, 2-y OS rate and 2-y DFS rate (all P<0.05). In patients with NPM1 or FLT3 -ITD mutations, the WT1 expression had no significantly predicting values in treatment efficacy and survival (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: WT1 gene overexpression indicated poor prognosis of AML patients; the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >= 1 log after the first induction therapy show better prognosis than those with<1 log. The WT1 gene expression level at diagnosis can be used as an unfavorable prognostic factor for AML patients with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD wild types.
