Title: Prognostic values of 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters and clinical figures in locally advanced pancreatic cancer underwent chemotherapy combined with stereotactic body radiation therapy.
Abstract: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged to be a preference treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic roles of F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters and clinical figures in LAPC patients underwent chemo-SBRT combined therapy.During January 2013 to January 2017, 23 LAPC patients who underwent F-FDG PET/CT within 2 weeks before treatment were recruited and retrospectively analyzed. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), chemoradiotherapy (CRT) sequence, and relevant clinical figures were grouped upon the median values, then analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models for their prognostic evaluation.The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of all patients were 16.7 months and 11.3 months, respectively. According to the statistic results, the longest diameter of tumor (LDT), MTV, TLG, and CRT sequence were associated with OS (all P <.05). Among which, LDT and MTV were proved to be the independent prognostic factors for OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.437, 3.015, both P <.05). Additionally, LDT and CRT sequence were found associated with PFS (both P <.05), and CRT sequence was the independent prognostic factor for PFS in chemo-SBRT treated LAPC patients (HR: 0.130, P <.05).For LAPC patients received chemotherapy and SBRT combined therapy, MTV and LDT showed independent prognostic values for OS. Meanwhile, CRT sequence was an independent PFS prediction factor.
