Title: The role of p53 isoforms' expression and p53 mutation status in renal cell cancer prognosis.
Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To analyze p53 mutations and gene expression of p53,  40p53, and  133p53 isoforms in renal cell cancer (RCC) tissues and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) and to associate them to clinical features and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-one randomly selected patients, with primary, previously untreated RCC, with complete clinicopathohistological data were analyzed. NAT samples were available for 37 cases. Expression of p53,  40p53 and  133p53 was determined using RT-qPCR. A functional yeast-based assay was performed to analyze p53 mutations. RESULTS: More than half (56.1%) of patients harbored functional p53 mutations, and they were significantly younger than those with wild type (WT) p53 (P = 0.032). Expression of p53,  40p53, and  133p53 was upregulated in mutant (MT) p53 RCC compared to WT p53 RCC tissues. However, there was no difference in expression of these isoforms between MT p53 RCC tissues and NAT. Expression of  133p53 was significantly downregulated in WT p53 tissues compared to NAT (P = 0.006). Patients that harbored functional p53 mutation had better overall survival (hazard ratio 4.32, 95% confidence interval 1.46-18.82, P = 0.006). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tumor stage and p53 mutation might be used as independent prognostic marker for overall survival in RCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the specific events in the carcinogenesis of RCC. p53 isoforms can be differentially expressed depending on p53 mutational status.
