Title: The prognostic significance of the long non-coding RNAs "CCAT1, PVT1" in t(8;21) associated Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Abstract: Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) is recently linked to various types of cancers, CCAT and PVT1 are two LncRNAs linked to t(8;21) associated Acute Myeloid Leukemia, the interplay between CCAT, PVT1 and the MYC proto-oncogene implicated in t(8;21) could present an opportunity for using LncRNA as prognostic biomarker or a target for therapy, We investigated the expression levels of LncRNAs in 70 patients; 30 with t(8;21) positive AML and 40 with t(8;21) negative AML, We found that CCAT1 and PVT1 are expressed in higher levels in t(8;21) positive -AML by 5.3 folds compared to t(8;21) negative group; the expression values were significantly associated with high-risk clinical criteria; moreover, they are associated with lower overall survival (OS) rate and leukemia-free survival (LFS), however we didn't find a statistically significant cut-off value of LncRNAs using the Cox regression analysis for Lnc_PVT1 except with LFS, we conclude that high expression levels of CCAT1 and PVT1 are associated with poor prognosis while being poor prognostic biomarkers in t(8;21) associated AML.
