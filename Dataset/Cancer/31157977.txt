Title: Analysis of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus gallolyticus in saliva of colorectal cancer patients.
Abstract: Aim: The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence and amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Streptococcus gallolyticus (Sg) in the saliva of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and controls. Methods: PCR analyses performed in 71 CRC patients and 77 controls. Results: Saliva samples of patients had higher amounts of Fn (p = 0.001) and Sg (p < 0.001) compared with controls. Amount of Fn and Sg were lower in the microsatellite instability (+) group. Evaluation of salivary Sg amount by receiver operating characteristics analysis found to have diagnostic value for CRC (AUC: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.96). Conclusion: We found higher amounts of Fn and Sg in the saliva of CRC patients. Salivary Sg could helpful in distinction of CRC.
