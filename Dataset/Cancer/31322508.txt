Title: MORPHOPHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS OF OVARIAN SEROUS BORDERLINE TUMORS.
Abstract: Borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) represent particular challenge for diagnosis and clinical management as they are characterized with the features of both benign cystadenomas and malignant carcinomas. The aim of our study was to investigate histomorphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of ovarian serous-papillary borderline tumors, compared to serous cystadenomas and low- and high-grade serous carcinomas. Altogether, 80 formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue specimens, distributed in four groups, including serous cystadenoma (group I), serous BOTs (group II), Low (group III) and high (group IV) grade serous carcinomas, were investigated by standard immunohistochemistry, using antibodies against CK7 CK20, WT1, Vimentin, CDX2, CEA, ER, cyclin D1, BCL2, E-cadherin, calretinin, SA125, Ki67, P53. Study results showed, that ovarian serous BOTs are characterized with slightly increase proliferative potential compared to benign cystadenomas, whilst apoptotic potential is retained with the difference from malignant serous carcinomas. p53 mutation is not present, as well as the expression of Vimentin. Overall, ovarian serous BOTs are characterized with highly variable immunohistochemical phenotype and the use of multiple immunohistochemical markers are recommended for the differential diagnosis from low grade serous carcinomas and benign cystadenomas.
