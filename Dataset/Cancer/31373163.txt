Title: Cytokine rs361525, rs1800750, rs1800629, rs1800896, rs1800872, rs1800795, rs1800470, and rs2430561 SNPs in relation with prognostic factors in acute myeloid leukemia.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cytokines were correlated with survival and disease progression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We aimed to evaluate the multivariate effect of TNF-alpha rs361525, rs1800750, rs1800629, IL-10 rs1800896, rs1800872, IL-6 rs1800795, TGF-beta1 rs1800470, IFN-gamma rs2430561 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on AML risk, the multivariate effect of SNPs on overall survival (OS) in AML and the association between the investigated SNPs and prognostic factors in AML. METHODS: All SNPs were genotyped in 226 adult AML cases and 406 healthy individuals. AML patients were investigated for FLT3 (ITD, D835), DNMT3A (R882), and NPM1 type A mutations. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that age above 65 years had a negative influence on survival (P < .001). The presence of the rs1800750 variant genotype (P = .005) or FLT3-ITD mutation (P = .009) in a cytogenetic high-risk group (P = .003) negatively influenced OS. A negative association was observed between Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group Scale status > 2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, platelet (PLT) count <40 000 cells/mm3 , and OS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of the rs1800750 variant genotype was a risk factor for death (P = .007), and that blast percentage, LDH level (>=600 IU/L), and cytogenetic high-risk were independent significant predictors for death in AML (P = .04, corrected HR = 1.20; P = .022, corrected HR = 1.24; P = .021, corrected HR = 1.34, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Age above 65 years, PLT count, TNF-alpha rs1800750 variant genotype, blast percentage, LDH level, and cytogenetic high-risk may be used as independent risk factors to assess AML mortality.
