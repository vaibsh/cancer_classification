Title: Dendritic Polyglycerol-Derived Nano-Architectures as Delivery Platforms of Gemcitabine for Pancreatic Cancer.
Abstract: Dendritic polyglycerol-co-polycaprolactone (PG-co-PCL)-derived block copolymers are synthesized and explored as nanoscale drug delivery platforms for a chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine (GEM), which is the cornerstone of therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Current treatment strategies with GEM result in suboptimal therapeutic outcome owing to microenvironmental resistance and rapid metabolic degradation of GEM. To address these challenges, physicochemical and cell-biological properties of both covalently conjugated and non-covalently stabilized variants of GEM-containing PG-co-PCL architectures have been evaluated. Self-assembly behavior, drug loading and release capacity, cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake properties of these constructs in monolayer and in spheroid cultures of PDAC cells are investigated. To realize the covalently conjugated carrier systems, GEM, in conjunction with a tertiary amine, is attached to the polycarbonate block grafted from the PG-co-PCL core. It is observed that pH-dependent ionization properties of these amine side-chains direct the formation of self-assembly of block copolymers in the form of nanoparticles. For non-covalent encapsulation, a facile "solvent-shifting" technique is adopted. Fabrication techniques are found to control colloidal and cellular properties of GEM-loaded nanoconstructs. The feasibility and potential of these newly developed architectures for designing carrier systems for GEM to achieve augmented prognosis for pancreatic cancer are reported.
