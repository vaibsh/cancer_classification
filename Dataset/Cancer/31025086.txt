Title: Integrated diagnostics of diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas are the most common neuroepithelial tumors. Their classification is based on the integration of histological and molecular findings according to the classification of tumors of the central nervous system published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016. OBJECTIVES: This review describes the different entities and variants of diffuse gliomas and summarizes the current diagnostic criteria for these tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the 2016 WHO classification and selected other publications, the histomolecular diagnostics of diffuse gliomas is presented and illustrated. RESULTS: Diffuse gliomas are divided into isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant or IDH-wildtype gliomas by detection of mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes. Among the IDH-mutant gliomas, oligodendroglial tumors are characterized by combined losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q. Loss of nuclear expression of the ATRX protein is a marker of IDH- mutant astrocytic gliomas. Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, is the most common diffuse glioma. Diffuse and anaplastic astrocytic gliomas without IDH mutation should be further evaluated for molecular features of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Diffuse gliomas in the thalamus, brainstem, or spinal cord carrying a histone 3 (H3)-K27M mutation are classified as diffuse midline gliomas, H3-K27M-mutant. By determining the IDH and 1p/19q status, oligoastrocytomas can be stratified into either astrocytic or oligodendroglial gliomas. Gliomatosis cerebri is no longer regarded as a distinct glioma entity. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse gliomas can today be classified accurately and reproducibly by means of histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses.
