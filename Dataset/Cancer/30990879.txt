Title: Differential Expression of Wilms' Tumor Protein in Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.
Abstract: Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are deadly tumors comprising 10%-15% of all childhood CNS cancers. Standard treatment is considered palliative and prognosis is near universal mortality. DIPGs have been classified into genomic subtypes based on histone variants with the lysine to methionine mutation on position 27 of histone tails (K27M). Given the increasing promise of immunotherapy, there have been ongoing efforts to identify tumor-specific antigens to serve as immunologic targets. We evaluated a large cohort of CNS specimens for Wilms' tumor protein (WT1) expression. These specimens include primary pediatric CNS tumors (n = 38 midline gliomas and n = 3 non-midline gliomas; n = 23 DIPG, n = 10 low-grade gliomas, n = 8 high-grade gliomas), and DIPG primary cells. Here, we report the validation of WT1 as a tumor-associated antigen in DIPGs. We further report that WT1 expression is significantly correlated with specific oncohistone variants, with the highest expression detected in the H3.3K27M subgroup. WT1 expression was absent in all control specimens (n = 21). Western blot assays using DIPG primary cells (n = 6) showed a trend of higher WT1 expression in H3.3K27M cells when compared with H3.1 K27M cells and H3 wildtype cells. Our data are the first indication of the association between WT1 and DIPG, with specific upregulation in those harboring oncohistone H3.3K27M.
