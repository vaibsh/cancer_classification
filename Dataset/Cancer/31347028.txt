Title: Clinical Evaluation of IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit for Detection of KRAS Mutations in Codon 12 and 13: A Novel Multiplex Approach.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most frequently occurring cancers worldwide and its incidence is forecasted to increase. Testing for KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutations in colorectal tissue biopsy samples has become a crucial tool to guide therapeutic decisions for personalized treatment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit using clinical specimens compared to Sanger sequencing as the reference method. METHODS: A total of 248 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, with CRC tumors comprising more than 10% of the whole tissue sample, were included in the study and analyzed for specific KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13. For samples with discordant results between Sanger sequencing and the IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit, Pyrosequencing was utilized to resolve the KRAS mutational status. RESULTS: Sequencing determined 153 specimens as KRAS wild-type genotype while the IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit confirmed 139 of the wild-type cases, resulting in a clinical specificity of 90.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 85.12-94.91). All 95 specimens with a reported mutation in codons 12 or 13 of KRAS by sequencing were also reported as non-wild-type by the IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit, resulting in a clinical sensitivity to detect KRAS mutations of 100% (95% CI 96.19-100). CONCLUSIONS: The IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit demonstrates suitable specificity and sensitivity for use in clinical laboratories to determine the mutational status of KRAS codons 12 and 13.
