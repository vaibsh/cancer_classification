Title: The Molecular Biologic Basis of Esophageal and Gastric Cancers.
Abstract: Esophageal cancer and gastric cancer are leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. In this article, the authors discuss the molecular biology of esophageal and gastric cancer with a focus on esophageal adenocarcinoma. They review data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project and advances in the molecular stratification and classification of esophageal carcinoma and gastric cancer. They also summarize advances in microRNA, molecular staging, gene expression profiling, tumor microenvironment, and detection of circulating tumor DNA. Finally, the authors summarize some of the implications of understanding the molecular basis of esophageal cancer and future directions in the management of esophageal cancer.
