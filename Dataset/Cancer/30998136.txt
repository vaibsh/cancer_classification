Title: [Mutation Spectrum of FANCJ Gene in Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To detect and analyze the mutation status of FANCJ gene in adult AML patients, so as to provide the basis for studying the mechanism of FANCJ driven AML and guiding the preventim and treatment of deseese. METHODS: The cDNAs were extracted and transeripted from bone marrow cells and normal skin cells in 222 newly diagnosed AML patients. The primers were designed for FANCJ gene coding region, the mutations of FANCJ gene coding region in AML patients as well as the mutations of FANCJ gene in mucous membrane epethelia in patients were detected by PCR and sanger seguencing; the evolutionary conservation of FANCJ mutation in different organisms was analyzed by NCBI Blast online bioinformaties software. RESULTS: The sequencing analysis showed that the mutations of FANCJ gene happened in 11 sites of FANCJ gene coding region, which were as followed: exon5:c.G430A:p.A144T, exon6:c.A587G:pN196S, exon9:c.C1255T:p.R419W, exon10:c.G1442A:p.G481D, exon11:c.C1609G:p.L537V, exon16:c.C2360T:p.P787L, exon17:c.C2440T:p.R814C, exon19:c.C2608T:pH870Y, exon19:c.A2686G:p.I896V, exon19:c.C2830G:p.Q944E, exon20:c.G3412A:p.D1138N. Among them, the repeatability existed in mutations of A144T, N196S, R814C, I896V and Q944E. Beside, the mutation sites of A144, R419, G381, L537, P787, H870, Q944 and D1138 were highly conserved in different organisms. CONCLUSION: Among 222 adult AML patients, the mutations of FANCJ gene have been found in 26 patients, moreover, the mutation sites are relatively conserved in different organisms, and possess important fanction. The results of this study provide the basis for exploring the mexhanism of FANCJ gene driven AML and for guiding the prevantion and treatment of AML.
