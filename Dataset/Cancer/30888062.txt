Title: Two novel variants in the ATM gene causing ataxia-telangiectasia, including a duplication of 90 kb: Utility of targeted next-generation sequencing in detection of copy number variation.
Abstract: Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, ocular apraxia, immunodeficiency, telangiectasia, elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration, radiosensitivity and cancer predisposition. Classical A-T is caused by biallelic variants on ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene, leading to a loss of function of the protein kinase ATM, involved in DNA damage repair. Atypical presentations can be found in A-T-like disease or in Nijmegen breakage syndrome, caused by deficiency of mre11 or nibrin proteins, respectively. In this report, we present the genetic characterization of a 4-year-old female with clinical diagnosis of A-T. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed two novel heterozygous mutations in the ATM gene: a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) at exon 47 (NM_000051.3:c.6899G > C; p.Trp2300Ser) and ~90 kb genomic duplication spanning exons 17-61, NG_009830.1:g.(41245_49339)_(137044_147250)dup. These findings were validated by Sanger sequencing and MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) analysis respectively. Familial segregation study confirmed that the two variants are inherited, and the infant is a compound heterozygote. Thus, our study expands the spectrum of ATM pathogenic variants and demonstrates the utility of targeted NGS in the detection of copy number variation.
