Title: Intraoral EBV-positive sporadic Burkitt lymphoma in an elderly patient with bilateral presentation.
Abstract: Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (SBL) is a variant of Burkitt lymphoma that occurs worldwide, affecting mainly children and young adults. Association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be identified in approximately 20-30% of cases. Herein we described a case of a 63-year-old male presenting intraoral bilateral mandibular swelling, subjacent to fixed dental prosthesis, with one month of duration. Incisional biopsies were performed, and after two days, the patient was hospitalized due to malaise and breathing difficulty, and died after a week when an abdominal tumor was detected. The mandibular biopsies revealed a diffuse proliferation of medium-sized monomorphic atypical lymphoid cells exhibiting numerous mitoses and areas of "starry-sky" pattern. The tumor showed immunohistochemical positivity for CD20, CD10, Bcl-6, and Ki-67 (  100%); it was negative for CD3, Bcl-2, Vs38c, and MUM-1. Positivity for EBV was found by in situ hybridization. The final diagnosis was intraoral SBL positive for EBV. Clinical, morphological and molecular criteria are necessary for the correct diagnosis of aggressive B-cell neoplasms positive for EBV in elderly patients.
