Title: Novel Noninvasive Diagnostics.
Abstract: Molecular diagnostics have revolutionized human oncology to allow early detection, targeted therapy, monitoring throughout treatment, and evidence of recurrence. By identifying genetic signatures associated with cancers, liquid biopsy techniques have been developed to diagnose and monitor cancer in noninvasive or minimally invasive ways. These techniques offer new opportunities for improving cancer screening, diagnosis, and monitoring the impact of therapy on the patients over time. Liquid biopsy also drives drug development programs. Similar diagnostics hold promise for comparable results in the veterinary field. Several noninvasive/minimally invasive techniques have been described in veterinary medicine that could be referred to as liquid biopsy.
