Title: MiR-193a regulates chemoresistance of human osteosarcoma cells via repression of IRS2.
Abstract: Chemoresistance prevents curative potential of chemotherapy in most cases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in regulating chemoresistance in osteosarcoma, which is the most common primary bone cancer. Bisulfite sequencing and quantitative real time PCR analyses showed that miR-193a expression is downregulated by DNA hypermethylation at its promoter region in a chemoresistant cell line, SJSA-1, compared to a chemosensitive cell line G-292. Introduction of a miR-193a mimic in SJSA-1 cells or an antagomir into G-292 cells confirmed the role of miR-193a in osteosarcoma chemoresistance. Bioinformatics together with biochemical assays showed that insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is a target of miR-193a. Our data concludes that miR-193a plays a role in the osteosarcoma chemoresistance and thus might serve as a useful biomarker for osteosarcoma prognosis.
