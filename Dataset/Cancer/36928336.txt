Title: Establishing an RNA fusions panel in soft tissue sarcoma with clinical validation.
Abstract: The diagnosis and classification of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) remain challenging because of the rarity and overlapping morphologic manifestations of diverse STS subtypes. Characteristic gene fusions are commonly detected in STS and represent useful diagnostic markers. This study established and validated a custom-designed RNA sequencing panel that identified 64 gene fusions in STS. The analytical performance validation yielded excellent accuracy, with 100% (95% CI, 94.40%-100%) sensitivity and 93.33% (95% CI, 68.05%-99.83%) specificity. Clinical performances were further confirmed with 145 clinical formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from STS patients. Fusions were detected in 40% of samples (58/145). The common fusions SS18-SSX family, EWSR1-related fusions, COL1A1-PDGFB, FOXO1-associated fusions, and FUS-associated fusions were identified in corresponding STS subtypes. The RNA panel detected specific fusions in several cases where no conclusive diagnosis can be made based on the morphology and immunohistochemistry results. Data collected in this study demonstrate that the RNA fusions panel can better classify STS subtypes and serve as a good supplement for histopathology, exhibiting a great potential for the STS precise diagnosis.
