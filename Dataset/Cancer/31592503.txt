Title: Integrative Molecular Analysis of Patients With Advanced and Metastatic Cancer.
Abstract: PURPOSE: We developed a precision medicine program for patients with advanced cancer using integrative whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred fifteen patients with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors were prospectively enrolled, and paired tumor/normal sequencing was performed. Seven hundred fifty-nine tumors from 515 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Most frequent tumor types were prostate (19.4%), brain (16.5%), bladder (15.4%), and kidney cancer (9.2%). Most frequently altered genes were TP53 (33%), CDKN2A (11%), APC (10%), KTM2D (8%), PTEN (8%), and BRCA2 (8%). Pathogenic germline alterations were present in 10.7% of patients, most frequently CHEK2 (1.9%), BRCA1 (1.5%), BRCA2 (1.5%), and MSH6 (1.4%). Novel gene fusions were identified, including a RBM47-CDK12 fusion in a metastatic prostate cancer sample. The rate of clinically relevant alterations was 39% by whole-exome sequencing, which was improved by 16% by adding RNA sequencing. In patients with more than one sequenced tumor sample (n = 146), 84.62% of actionable mutations were concordant. CONCLUSION: Integrative analysis may uncover informative alterations for an advanced pan-cancer patient population. These alterations are consistent in spatially and temporally heterogeneous samples.
