Title: Subtyping of microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC) generally have a better prognosis than patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. However, some MSI-H CRC patients do not gain overall survival benefits from immune checkpoint-blockade treatment. In other words, heterogeneity within the subgroup of MSI-H tumors remains poorly understood. Thus, an in-depth molecular characterization of MSI-H tumors is urgently required. METHODS: Here, we use nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based consensus clustering to define CRC MSI-H subtypes in The Cancer Genome Atlas and a French multicenter cohort GSE39582. CIBERSORT was used to calculate the proportions of 22 lymphocytes in tumor tissue in MSI-H subtypes. RESULTS: MSI-H CRC samples basically clustered into two subgroups (MSI-H1 and MSI-H2). MSI-H1 was characterized by a lower BRAF mutational status, higher frequency of chromosomal instability, global hypomethylation, and worse survival than MSI-H2. Further examination of the immune landscape showed that macrophages of the M2 phenotype were enriched in MSI-H1, which may be associated with poor prognosis in this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the genetic heterogeneity in MSI-H CRCs and macrophages may serve as good targets for anticancer therapy in MSI-H1.
