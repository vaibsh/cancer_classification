Title: Tumour biomarkers-Tracing the molecular function and clinical implication.
Abstract: In recent years, with the increase in cancer mortality caused by metastasis, and with the development of individualized and precise medical treatment, early diagnosis with precision becomes the key to decrease the death rate. Since detecting tumour biomarkers in body fluids is the most non-invasive way to identify the status of tumour development, it has been widely investigated for the usage in clinic. These biomarkers include different expression or mutation in microRNAs (miRNAs), circulating tumour DNAs (ctDNAs), proteins, exosomes and circulating tumour cells (CTCs). In the present article, we summarized and discussed some updated research on these biomarkers. We overviewed their biological functions and evaluated their multiple roles in human and small animal clinical treatment, including diagnosis of cancers, classification of cancers, prognostic and predictive values for therapy response, monitors for therapy efficacy, and anti-cancer therapeutics. Biomarkers including different expression or mutation in miRNAs, ctDNAs, proteins, exosomes and CTCs provide more choice for early diagnosis of tumour detection at early stage before metastasis. Combination detection of these tumour biomarkers may provide higher accuracy at the lowest molecule combination number for tumour early detection. Moreover, tumour biomarkers can provide valuable suggestions for clinical anti-cancer treatment and execute monitoring of treatment efficiency.
