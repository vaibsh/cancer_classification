The patient received a total of4 2 treatment courses. After an initial phase of stable disease due to chemotherapy, she eventually showed progressive disease. S-1 chemotherapy was discontinued. Because ofher social background, she decided against any further chemotherapy. After 1 year, she underwent metallic stent insertion through the gastric cancer, which enabled her to consume food. She is currently alive as of 5 years and 3 months from the date of first diagnosis.
