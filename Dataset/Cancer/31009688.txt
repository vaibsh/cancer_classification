Title: Hepatic complications of oral contraceptive pills and estrogen on MRI: Controversies and update - Adenoma and beyond.
Abstract: Hepatic complications of oral contraceptive pills and exogenous estrogens include intrahepatic canalicular cholestasis, neoplasm formation and vascular pathologies. While it remains controversial as to whether estrogen plays a role in focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma or hamartoma, exposure to oral contraceptive pills and estrogen has a strong association with hepatic adenomas. Four different subgroups of adenomas have been described: Inflammatory, HNF-1alpha-mutated, beta-catenin-mutated and unclassified. Vascular complications may include Budd-Chiari syndrome, vascular thrombosis, dilated sinusoids and peliosis.
