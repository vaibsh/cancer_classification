Title: Blastic variant of plasma cell myeloma mimicking squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix in a super-morbidly obese female.
Abstract:  Plasmablastic plasma cell myelomas of the cervix can mimic the more common cervical squamous cell carcinoma. It can be difficult to differentiate plasmablastic lymphoma of the cervix from cervical plasmablastic plasma cell myeloma. The clinician must rely on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings to diagnose genital plasma cell myeloma. Prompt diagnosis of this rare clinical condition can potentially allow timely treatment with systemic chemotherapy.
