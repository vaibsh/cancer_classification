Title: [Multiple hemorragic brain lesions revealing metastatic melanoma].
Abstract: Nearly 75% of patients with metastatic melanoma develop brain metastases. We here report the case of an 83 year-old woman hospitalized for secondarily generalized clonic seizures of the left leg with partial convulsive seizures in the Resuscitation Department. Melanoma resection of the left ankle had been performed 6 months before her admission. Neurological examination showed left ataxic crural monoparesis. Electro-encephalogram showed central and right frontal focus with left-sided dissemination. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple supratentorial and subtentorial encephalic lesions with varying size and shape, with T1 hypersignal (A and A'), haemorrhage on T2*-weighted sequences (B and B'), gadolinium-enhancing T1 with perilesional edema on Flair sequences. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed multiple lymph node and bone metastases. Lymph node biopsy was negative for VE1 antibody with no BRAFV600E mutation by immunohistochemistry. An increase in the number of metastatic lesions was observed during control brain CT scan despite 10 brain radiotherapy sessions motivating palliative care. Epileptic seizures were controlled with levetiracetam. In patient with multiple hemorrhagic and spontaneous brain lesions, it is essential to obtain informations on patient's history of melanoma and to perform a thorough dermatologic examination in order to investigate its cause and to establish adequate therapeutic treatment.
