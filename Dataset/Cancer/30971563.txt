Title: Epithelioid sarcoma of paratesticular region: A case report of an unusual case.
Abstract: Primary tumors of the paratesticular region are rare, with sarcomas constituting a major proportion, particularly in the old age. The paratesticular region consists of mesothelial, various epithelial, and mesenchymal cells and may therefore give rise to a variety of tumors. Epithelioid sarcoma usually occurs at the distal extremities of young adults. The proximal-type variant is characterized by a more aggressive course and resistance to treatment. We herein report a case of 32 years male with scrotal swelling diagnosed as proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma of paratesticular region after histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second case of proximal epithelioid sarcoma of paratesticular region in the English literature. As these tumors are rare, it has been difficult to establish their optimal treatment. Also, these can be easily misdiagnosed as other epithelioid lesions.
