Title: Anti-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor GluR2 encephalitis in a myasthenia gravis patient with complete thymectomy: a case report.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a newly recognized autoimmune disorders in which the targets are proteins or receptors involved in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) is a subtype of glutamate receptor that mediates most of the fast excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old woman presented with subacute onset of memory loss and behavioral changes. High levels of serum (1:1000) and CSF (1:32) antibodies against the AMPAR GluR2 were detected. A wide range of abnormalities in 6-8 Hz low to middle slow waves was found by electroencephalographs, and high-intensity signals on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in both the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus were identified on brain magnetic resonance images. This patient presented with myasthenia gravis and type B2 thymoma (World Health Organization Thymoma Classification) at age 48. This case was unique in that the patient initiated with the symptom of myasthenia gravis and thymoma two years prior to encephalitis, and a complete thymectomy was performed before AE onset without recurrence of the thymoma when encephalitis occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Thymoma was reported to be associated with paraneoplastic neurological disease. This is the first time a thymectomy has been applied in a myasthenia gravis patient with thymoma two years prior to the onset of anti-AMPAR2 encephalitis. This case highlights the complexity of autoimmune encephalitis associated with thymoma.
