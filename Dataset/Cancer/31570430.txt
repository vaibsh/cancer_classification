Title: Promoter Methylation Down-regulates B-cell Translocation Gene 1 Expression in Breast Carcinoma.
Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIM: The mechanism responsible for B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) down-regulation in breast carcinoma remains unknown. We examined the BTG1 expression status in breast carcinoma cells and investigated the mechanism underlying the observed alterations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four breast carcinoma cell lines (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, T-47D, and MCF-7), and one normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) were analyzed. BTG1 expression was examined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot. Methylation status of the BTG1 promoter was analyzed using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). To investigate the effect of methylation on BTG1, the cells were treated with a demethylating agent. RESULTS: The carcinoma cells expressed significantly lower levels of BTG1 mRNA and protein than normal cells. The BTG1 promoter was highly methylated in the carcinoma cells. 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine significantly restored BTG1 expression. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of BTG1 expression through epigenetic repression is involved in mammary carcinogenesis. BTG1 is a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for breast carcinoma.
