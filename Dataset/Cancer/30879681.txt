Title: Inhibition of tumor growth by beta-glucans through promoting CD4+ T cell immunomodulation and neutrophil-killing in mice.
Abstract: beta-glucans are polysaccharides comprising beta-D-glucoses with various bioactivities. Herein, we extracted three beta-glucans from Lentinus edodes with different sources and assessed their antitumor activities on a mice model with intragastric, intraperitoneal and intratumoral injection. Three polysaccharides were shown to have the same chemical structure of beta-(1,3)-glucan with beta-(1,6) branches, and exhibited S-180 tumor-suppressing ability with good safety. It was found that beta-glucans up-regulated CD4+ T cell level in lymphoid organs decreased by tumor-burden, indicating promotion of immunomodulation. beta-glucans targeted tumors in vivo even after oral or intraperitoneal injection. Furthermore, beta-glucans not only targeted to lymphoid organs and increased CD4+ T cells number, but also enhanced CD4+ T cells and neutrophils populations in tumors. It was proposed that beta-glucans promoted CD4+ T cell immunomodulation and neutrophils infiltration into tumors, leading to tumor growth inhibition. These findings reveal that beta-glucans can be used as an effective agent for cancer immunotherapy.
