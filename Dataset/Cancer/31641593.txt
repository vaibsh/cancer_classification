Title: Malignant fibrous histiocytoma arising from the renal capsule and gene mutation screening: A case report.
Abstract: Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma. Renal MFH is rare and information about its molecular characterization is limited. We present here the case of a 77-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a huge right renal mass on computed tomography. Radical nephrectomy was performed. Pathological diagnosis was MFH arising from the renal capsule. We used Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel version 2 primers to perform gene mutation screening. We detected 13 mutations in 11 hotspot oncogenes (CSF1R, FGFR3, KDR, APC, PDGFRA, TP53, FLT3, ERBB4, KIT, STK11, RET), but these were not matched to driver mutations.
