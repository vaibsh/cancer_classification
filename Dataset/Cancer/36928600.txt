Title: Characterization of pancreatic cancer with ultra-low tumor mutational burden.
Abstract: In pancreatic cancer (PC), Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been reported to be lower than in other cancers, with its clinical significance remaining unclear. We analyzed the dataset of whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling of 93 resected PC cases. The median TMB was 0.24. The TMB was classified as High (≥ 5.0), Low (< 5.0, ≥ 1.0), or Ultra-low (< 1.0). Nineteen samples (20%) were classified as TMB-low, and 74 (80%) were classified as TMB-ultra-low; no samples were TMB-high. TMB-ultra-low PC had significantly fewer borderline resectable lesions (P = 0.028) and fewer adenosquamous carcinomas (P = 0.003) than TBM-low PC. Furthermore, the TMB-ultra-low PC showed significantly lower detection rates of driver mutations and copy number variations. Microsatellite instability was not significantly correlated with the TMB status. The TMB-ultra-low PC had a significantly better prognosis than TBM-low PC (P = 0.023). A multivariate analysis identified TMB-ultra-low PC as an independent favorable prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 2.11; P = 0.019). A gene expression analysis showed that TMB-ultra-low PC was associated with reduced TP53 inactivation (P = 0.003) and reduced chromosomal instability (P = 0.001) compared to TBM-low PC. TMB-ultra-low PC had specific gene expression signatures and a better prognosis than TMB-low PC.
