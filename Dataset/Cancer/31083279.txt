Title: Oncogenic Effect of the Novel Fusion Gene VAPA-Rab31 in Lung Adenocarcinoma.
Abstract: Fusion genes have been identified as oncogenes in several solid tumors including lung, colorectal, and stomach cancers. Here, we characterized the fusion gene, VAPA-Rab31, discovered from RNA-sequencing data of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who did not harbor activating mutations in EGFR, KRAS and ALK. This fusion gene encodes a protein comprising the N-terminal region of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAPA) fused to the C-terminal region of Ras-related protein 31 (Rab31). Exogenous expression of VAPA-Rab31 in immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated the potential transforming effects of this fusion gene, including increased colony formation and cell proliferation in vitro. Also, enhanced tumorigenicity upon VAPA-Rab31 was confirmed in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. Metastatic tumors were also detected in the liver and lungs of xenografted mice. Overexpression of VAPA-Rab31 upregulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and phosphorylated CREB both in cells and xenograft tumors. Reduced apoptosis and increased phosphorylation of CREB and Erk were observed in VAPA-Rab31-overexpressing cells after bortezomib treatment. Elevated Bcl-2 level via activated CREB contributed to the resistance to the bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest the oncogenic function of the novel fusion gene VAPA-Rab31 via upregulated Bcl-2 and activated CREB in lung cancer.
