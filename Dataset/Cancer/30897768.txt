Title: Breast Cancer and miR-SNPs: The Importance of miR Germ-Line Genetics.
Abstract: Recent studies in cancer diagnostics have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) as promising cancer biomarkers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA binding sites, seed regions, and coding sequences can help predict breast cancer risk, aggressiveness, response to stimuli, and prognosis. This review also documents significant known miR-SNPs in miRNA biogenesis genes and their effects on gene regulation in breast cancer, taking into account the genetic background and ethnicity of the sampled populations. When applicable, miR-SNPs are evaluated in the context of other patient factors, including mutations, hormonal status, and demographics. Given the power of miR-SNPs to predict patient cancer risk, prognosis, and outcomes, further study of miR-SNPs is warranted to improve efforts towards personalized medicine.
