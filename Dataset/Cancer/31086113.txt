Title: A Comparison of DNA Mutation and Copy Number Profiles of Primary Breast Cancers and Paired Brain Metastases for Identifying Clinically Relevant Genetic Alterations in Brain Metastases.
Abstract: Improving the systemic treatment of brain metastases (BM) in primary breast cancer (PBC) is impaired by the lack of genomic characterization of BM. To estimate the concordance of DNA copy-number-alterations (CNAs), mutations, and actionable genetic alterations (AGAs) between paired samples, we performed whole-genome array-comparative-genomic-hybridization, and targeted-next-generation-sequencing on 14 clinical PBC-BM pairs. We found more CNAs, more mutations, and higher tumor mutational burden, and more AGAs in BM than in PBC; 92% of the pairs harbored at least one AGA in the BM not observed in the paired PBC. This concerned various therapeutic classes, including tyrosine-kinase-receptor-inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/ mammalian Target of Rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/MTOR)-inhibitors, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-inhibitors, or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-inhibitors. With regards to the PARP-inhibitors, the homologous recombination defect score was positive in 79% of BM, compared to 43% of PBC, discordant in 7 out of 14 pairs, and positive in the BM in 5 out of 14 cases. CDK-inhibitors were associated with the largest percentage of discordant AGA appearing in the BM. When considering the AGA with the highest clinical-evidence level, for each sample, 50% of the pairs harbored an AGA in the BM not detected or not retained from the analysis of the paired PBC. Thus, the profiling of BM provided a more reliable opportunity, than that of PBC, for diagnostic decision-making based on genomic analysis. Patients with BM deserve an investigation of several targeted therapies.
