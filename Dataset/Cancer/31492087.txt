Title: [Genetic testing of thyroid nodules using a gene panel developed on a new generation sequencing platform].
Abstract: Introduction: Twenty-five percent of fine-needle aspiration biopsy samples of thyroid nodules produce indeterminate cytological results. Genetic testing of nodules can contribute to accurate diagnosis. Aim: Developing the first gene panel in Europe utilizing the 23 most relevant thyroid oncogenes with 568 mutations. Method: Examination of the isolated DNA from biopsy samples by Ion Torrent new generation sequencing. Results: The validation of our method was performed on tumor tissue samples, in which 127 genetic variations were identified, yet unknown in thyroid tumors. AXIN1 was the most polymorphic gene, while BRAF c.1799T>A (V600E) was the most frequently identified mutation. We detected 36 clinically relevant variants, 75% of which have not been described in the literature. Six of our 8 cytologically malignant and 8 of our 14 indeterminate as well as 20 of our 28 cytologically benign samples were identified as containing pathologic variants in a driver gene (BRAF c.1799T>A, NRAS c.181C>A). Conclusion: We have developed a validated, reliable new generation sequencing-based method with high positive predictive value (89%) and sensitivity (79%), suitable for the early detection of malignant lesions in the thyroid.
