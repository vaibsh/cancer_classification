Title: [Characterizing the molecular cytogenetics in acute monocytic leukemia].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To characterize the molecular genetics of 81 patients with acute monocytic leukemia (AML). METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was employed to detect MLL gene rearrangements. Combined mutations of 17 genes were detected by DNA-based PCR and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Sixty seven patients were found to harbor at least one mutation. The most commonly mutated gene was NPM1 (n=18), which was followed by FLT3-ITD (n=16), NRAS (n=16), DNMT3A (n=15), TET2 (n=12), RUNX1 (n=11) and KRAS (n=9). Based on the functions of mutated genes, the most frequently involved genes were those involved in DNA methylation (38.27%), tyrosine kinase receptor signaling (32.1%), transcription regulation (28.4%), and RAS pathway (24.7%). Single gene mutation predominated in patient with cytogenetic abnormalities, while coexistence of 2 mutations have predominated in patient with normal cytogenetic findings. Stratified by cytogenetic findings, patients with single gene mutations (intermediate-risk group) had significantly higher complete remission (CR) rates than those with >=2 gene mutations (unfavorable-risk group) (91.7% vs. 57.6% , 87.5% vs. 25.0%, P =0.0319, 0.0117, respectively). CONCLUSION: Over 80% of AML patients were found to harbor at least one mutation. Their clinical phenotype and prognosis may be impacted by the synergy of MLL gene rearrangement and multiple mutations. For patients under the same risk stratification, the number of mutations is reversely correlated with the CR rate.
