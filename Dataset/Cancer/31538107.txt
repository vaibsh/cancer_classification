Title: Malignant struma ovarii presenting with follicular carcinoma: A case report with molecular analysis.
Abstract: Malignant struma ovarii presenting with follicular carcinoma is extremely rare, and its mechanism of tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here, we present a case of malignant struma ovarii with peritoneal dissemination of follicular carcinoma, for which a molecular analysis for major oncogenic gene alterations in follicular thyroid carcinoma was performed. A 39-year-old nulliparous woman was referred with a diagnosis of highly differentiated follicular carcinoma of ovarian origin. Primary thyroid cancer was not diagnosed, and she had a normal thyroid function. 123I scintigraphy revealed multiple peritoneal dissemination that was surgically resected. Histologically, the tumor consisted of numerous follicles without nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Tumor samples were investigated for 50 cancer-related genes, including RAS, BRAF, and p53, and PPARg-PAX8 gene fusion by targeted DNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively. No major oncogenic gene alterations were detected. These negative findings suggest a different mechanism of tumorigenesis from that of adult-type follicular thyroid carcinoma.
