Title: [Hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma/PEComa and focal nodular hyperplasia in a patient with a previous history of cutaneous melanoma].
Abstract: Hepatic perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are uncommon mesenchymal neoplasms. PEComas concurrent with other hepatic lesions is a very rare occurrence, with only two previously reported cases. We report a primary hepatic PEComa associated with focal nodular hyperplasia in a patient with a previous history of cutaneous melanoma. Diagnostic imaging studies suggested a hepatic adenoma and the patient underwent a segmentectomy. The tumor was mainly composed of epithelioid cells, adipose tissue and smooth muscle fibers intermixed with blood vessels. The neoplastic cells were diffusely immunoreactive for HMB-45, Melan-A and smooth muscle actin, but not for Hepatocyte, S100, MITF or BRAF. Molecular studies were negative for BRAFV600 mutation. The final diagnosis was hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma/PEComa. The differential diagnosis of hepatic PEComa is discussed.
