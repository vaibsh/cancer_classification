Title: Mutational profiling of poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma by the use of targeted next-generation sequencing.
Abstract: AIMS: To characterise the mutational profiles of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) and to identify markers with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic significance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Targeted next-generation sequencing with a panel of 18 thyroid carcinoma-related genes was performed on tissue samples from 41 PDTC and 25 ATC patients. Genetic alterations and their correlations with clinicopathological factors, including survival outcomes, were also analysed. Our results showed that ATC had significantly higher mutation rates of BRAF, TP53, TERT and PIK3CA than PDTC (P = 0.005, P = 0.007, P = 0.005, and P = 0.033, respectively). Nine (69%) ATC cases with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) components harboured BRAF mutations, all of which coexisted with a late mutation event (TP53, TERT, or PIK3CA). Nine cases with oncogenic fusion (six RET cases, one NTRK1 case, one ALK case, and one PPARG case) were identified in 41 PDTCs, whereas only one case with oncogenic fusion (NTRK1) was found among 25 ATCs. Moreover, all six cases of RET fusion were found in PDTC with PTC components, accounting for 33%. In PDTC/ATC patients, concurrent TERT and PIK3CA mutations were associated with poor overall survival after adjustment for TNM stage (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ATC with PTC components is typically characterised by a BRAF mutation with a late mutation event, whereas PDTC with PTC components is more closely correlated with RET fusion. TERT and concurrent PIK3CA mutations predict worse overall survival in PDTC/ATC patients.
