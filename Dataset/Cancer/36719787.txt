Title: Intratumor Injection of Thermosensitive Polypeptide with Resveratrol Inhibits Glioblastoma Growth.
Abstract: Local tumor treatment is a feasible measure for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) who are unsuitable for surgical resection. Interferon-elastin-like polypeptide [IFN-ELP(V)] is a slow-release, biodegradable, thermosensitive fusion protein with antitumor immunity, and resveratrol (Res) is a polyphenolic compound with an antitumor effect. In this study, we found that intratumor injection of IFN-ELP(V) combined with intraperitoneal injection of Res is more effective in delaying GBM growth in mice. Specifically, in an orthotopic GBM model, we found a significant improvement in the median survival with this strategy. Our results suggested that the combined use of IFN-ELP(V) and Res has a dramatic synergistic effect on GBM, thus providing a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for tumors. Impact statement We report a novel and effective strategy in which the combined use of interferon-elastin-like polypeptide [IFN-ELP(V)] and Res effectively inhibits glioblastoma growth. IFN-ELP(V) can create a reservoir in the tumor and continuously release IFN to produce a powerful <i>in situ</i> antitumor immune response; furthermore, the combination of IFN-ELP(V) and Res is more effective in inhibiting tumor growth.
