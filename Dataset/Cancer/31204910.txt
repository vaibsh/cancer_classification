Title: [Clinical Features and Therapeutic Efficacy in Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with t (1; 19) (E2A-PBX1)].
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical features and therapeutic efficacy in adult ALL patients with t (1; 19) (E2A-PBX1). METHODS: The clinic data of 19 adult ALL patients with t (1; 19) (E2A-PBX1) in our hospital from Nov. 22, 2010 to Apr. 4, 2018 were collected. The clinical features,complete remission (CR) rate, overall survival (OS) rate and relapse-free survival (RFS) rate of patients received chemotherapy and chemotherapy+HSCT were analyzed. RESULTS: In all the 19 patients, the median age was 24 (14-66), median WBC count was 16.47x109 (1.8-170.34)/L, median Hb level was 98 (65-176) g/L, median Plt count was 50 (15-254)x109/L. Pre B-ALL were 17 cases (89.5%), and common B-ALL were 2 cases (10.5%). Patients received the induction therapy, the overall CR rate was 94.7%, one course CR rate was 94.7%, 4 year OS rate was 47.1% and RFS rate was 43.3%. The OS rate and RFS rate of patients received transplantation were slightly higher than those of patients not received transplantation (OS: 62.5% vs 36.7%) (P=0.188);RFS (62.5% vs 38.9%) (P=0.166). CONCLUSION: Most adult ALL patients with t (1; 19) (E2A-PBX1) is Pre B-ALL by Immunophenotyping, as compared with the pediatric patients, the therapeutic efficacy for adult patients with t (1; 19) (E2A-PBX1) is worsen, therefore, stem cell transplantation is still acquired for better long term survival.
