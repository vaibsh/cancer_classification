Title: Prostaglandin E-Major Urinary Metabolite (PGE-MUM) as a Tumor Marker for Lung Adenocarcinoma.
Abstract: Background: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is metabolized to prostaglandin E-major urinary metabolite (PGE-MUM). Enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression demonstrated in lung adenocarcinoma indicates increased PGE-MUM levels in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Objectives: We aimed to elucidate the clinical usefulness of measuring PGE-MUM as an indicator of tumor burden in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: PGE-MUM was measured by a radioimmunoassay in control healthy volunteers (n = 124) and patients with lung adenocarcinoma (n = 54). Associations between PGE-MUM levels and clinical characteristics of the patients (including lung cancer stage and TNM factors (T: Tumor, N: Node, M: Metastasis) were examined. Results: PGE-MUM levels were significantly elevated in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. A PGE-MUM level of 14.9 mug/g Cr showed 70.4% sensitivity and 67.7% specificity for the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. PGE-MUM levels tended to be positively correlated with cancer progression as determined by the TNM staging system. Advanced stage (stage III, stage IV, and recurrence) was significantly associated with high PGE-MUM levels by logistic regression analysis. No apparent correlation was demonstrated between PGE-MUM and carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Conclusions: PGE-MUM can be a promising biomarker reflecting the systemic tumor burden of lung adenocarcinoma.
