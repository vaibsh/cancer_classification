Title: Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas with thyroid-like follicular features: first description of a new diagnostic challenging subtype.
Abstract: Acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) of the pancreas are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms showing a wide spectrum of morphological features including acinar, solid, glandular, and trabecular architecture. In addition, uncommon cytological aspects have recently been described and include oncocytic, spindle, clear, and pleomorphic cell types. This wide histological spectrum represents a challenge in the diagnostic task for pathologists. Molecular mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of ACCs are not completely known, but, in general, they differ from those observed in ductal adenocarcinomas or neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas and frequently include alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway. In the present paper, we describe a new variant of ACC showing thyroid-like follicular features and CTNNB1 mutation. This phenotype needs to be included in the spectrum of morphological presentation of ACC.
