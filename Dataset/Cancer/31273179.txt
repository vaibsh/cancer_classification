Abstract: Complete visceral inversion occurs in 1/5,000 individuals. In 64%of cases, complete visceral inversion is complicated by the malformation of other organs. Careful attention is required when performing surgeries. In recent years, with the development of laparoscopic surgery, some cases of laparoscopic surgery with complete visceral inversion have been reported. Herein, we report a case of safely performed laparoscopic surgery for sigmoid colon cancer with complete visceral inversion along with a relevant discussion.
