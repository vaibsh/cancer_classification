Title: [Acute myeloid leukemia evolving from KIT D816-mutated systemic mastocytosis relapsing two months after completion of chemotherapy].
Abstract: Here, we report the case of a 9-year-old girl with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) developed from systemic mastocytosis (SM). She experienced bladder and rectal disturbance due to an extramedullary nodule in the paraspinal region of the sacrum. Cytogenetic and genetic analyses of leukemic cells revealed the KIT D816Y mutation besides t (8;21) (q22:q22) /RUNX1-RUNX1T1. Despite receiving proton beam therapy after conventional chemotherapy, the patient relapsed after 2 months. As SM-AML with the KIT D816 mutation in adults exhibits a poor prognosis, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended. Owing to a few reports of SM-AML in children, the standard therapy for pediatric cases has not been established to date. Based on our experience and the related literature, the prognosis of childhood SM-AML could be as poor as in adults. Hence, further investigation, including mutational analyses of the KIT gene, is warranted to establish a risk-oriented strategy for managing childhood SM-AML.
