Title: Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma with t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation: long-term follow-up results.
Abstract: Translocation (11;18)(q21;q21) is found in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, resulting in API2/MALT1 gene fusion. It is known that t(11;18)-positive MALT lymphoma shows a tendency to disseminate and be resistant to Helicobacter pylori eradication by antibiotics. However, the prognostic features including recurrence and histological transformation (HT) remain unknown. We conducted a single-institute retrospective analysis of 464 patients with newly diagnosed MALT lymphoma, evaluating the impact of t(11;18) on clinical outcomes. One hundred and six patients were screened for the translocation by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Of these patients, 26 patients (25%) were diagnosed as MALT lymphoma with t(11;18). The patients had a significantly shortened progression-free survival (PFS at 10 years; 26% v 57%; P = 0.004) compared to those without t(11;18). However, this did not translate into overall survival or incidence of HT. We confirmed previous reports stating that t(11;18)-positive MALT lymphoma showed disseminated disease and refractoriness to H. pylori eradication therapy. Patients with t(11;18) had more frequent monoclonal gammopathy, especially of IgM subtype (31% v 8%; P = 0.008), some of which developed class switch. These findings characterize the features of t(11;18)-positive MALT lymphoma, suggesting that it comprises a distinct clinical entity of MALT lymphoma.
