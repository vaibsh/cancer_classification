Title: Clinicopathological features, diagnosis, and treatment of sessile serrated adenoma/polyp with dysplasia/carcinoma.
Abstract: Sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (SSA/Ps) are early precursor lesions in the serrated neoplasia pathway, which results in BRAF-mutated colorectal carcinomas with not only high levels of microsatellite instability but also microsatellite stable. SSA/Ps with advanced histology, including cytological dysplasia or minimally invasive carcinomas, are important lesions because SSA/Ps are considered major contributors to "interval cancers" and these lesions can rapidly become dysplastic or invasive carcinomas. Clinicopathologically, SSA/Ps with dysplasia or invasive carcinoma were associated with advanced age, female sex, and proximal colon. Although SSA/Ps with submucosal invasive carcinoma were smaller and invaded less deeply into the submucosal layer than conventional tubular adenomas with submucosal invasive carcinoma, SSA/Ps with submucosal invasive carcinoma frequently had a mucinous component and exhibited a higher potential for lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis. In an SSA/P series, endoscopic characteristics, including (semi)pedunculated morphology, double elevation, central depression, and reddishness, may help accurately diagnose SSA/Ps with advanced histology. Removal of SSA/Ps with dysplasia or invasive carcinoma was recommended. Endoscopic treatment such as endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection is useful for those lesions. However, surgical resection with lymph node dissection might be indicated when SSA/Ps with invasive carcinoma are endoscopically suspected, because these have the high risk of lymph node metastasis. Greater awareness may promote further research into improving the detection, recognition, and complete resection rates of SSA/Ps with dysplasia or invasive carcinoma and reduce the interval cancer rates.
