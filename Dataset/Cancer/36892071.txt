Title: Investigation of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-<i>a</i>]quinolines as potential antiproliferative agents.
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> It has been demonstrated that the lead compound 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-<i>a</i>]quinoline <b>1a</b> selectively inhibits CYP1 enzymes. Additionally, CYP1 inhibition has been linked to inducing antiproliferative effects in various breast cancer cell lines as well as relieving drug resistance caused by CYP1 upregulation. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Herein, 54 novel analogs of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-<i>a</i>]quinoline <b>1a</b> have been synthesized with varied substitution on the phenyl and imidazole rings. Antiproliferative testing was conducted using <sup>3</sup>H thymidine uptake assays. <b>Results:</b> 2-Phenylimidazo[1,2-<i>a</i>]quinoline <b>1a</b> and phenyl-substituted analogs <b>1c</b> (3-OMe), <b>1n</b> (2,3-napthalene) displayed excellent anti-proliferative activities, demonstrating their potency against cancer cell lines for the first time. Molecular modeling suggested that <b>1c</b> and <b>1n</b> bind similarly to <b>1a</b> in the CYP1 binding site.
