Title: PDGFRB and NOTCH3 Mutations are Detectable in a Wider Range of Pericytic Tumors, Including Myopericytomas, Angioleiomyomas, Glomus Tumors, and Their Combined Tumors.
Abstract: Pericytic tumors are subclassified as myopericytomas, myofibromas, angioleiomyomas, and glomus tumors according to the current World Health Organization classification. These pericytic tumors form a continuous morphologic spectrum, including those with combined morphology. However, to our knowledge, no widely accepted criteria for classifying tumors with combined morphology are available. Recent studies have identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRB) gene mutations in a subset of myofibromas, myopericytomas, and myopericytomatoses but not in angioleiomyomas. NOTCH receptor 3 (NOTCH3) mutations have been reported in a subset of infantile myofibromatosis. To assess their potential role in classifying pericytic tumors, we investigated PDGFRB and NOTCH3 mutations in 41 pericytic tumors of variable morphology, including some combined forms. Our results show these mutations to be present in a variety of pericytic tumors, such as myopericytomas (PDGFRB, 3/11; NOTCH3, 4/11), myopericytomatoses (1/2; 1/2), myofibromas (3/6; 0/6), angioleiomyomas (2/13; 3/13), and glomus tumors (5/9; 1/9). Point mutations were identified in 3 tumors in PDGFRB exon 12 (Y562C, S574F, and G576S), 12 tumors in PDGFRB exon 14 (M655I, H657L, and N666K), and 9 tumors in NOTCH3 exon 25 (A1480S/T, D1481N, G1482S, T1490A, E1491K, G1494S, and V1512A). All PDGFRB mutations and NOTCH3 G1482S, T1490A, and G1494S mutations were classified as "deleterious/damaging" by â‰¥4 of 6 pathogenicity prediction tools in silico. Five-mutation-positive tumors, including 1 myopericytoma-angioleiomyoma, 2 myopericytomatoses-myofibroma, 1 myofibroma-myopericytoma and 1 angioleiomyoma-myopericytoma, were of combined morphology. Therefore, we found PDGFRB and NOTCH3 mutations to be detectable in a much wider variety of pericytic tumors than previously reported and confirmed myopericytomas, myofibromas, angioleiomyomas, and glomus tumors as members harboring PDGFRB or NOTCH3 mutations. Our results thus suggest that PDGFRB or NOTCH3 mutations are not useful for subclassifying members of the pericytic tumor family.
