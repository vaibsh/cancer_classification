Title: [An integral view of cancer (I). The study, classification and reprogramming of the tumoral microclimate].
Abstract: The group of diseases that we call cancer share a biological structure formed by a complex ecosystem, with altered intercellular communication, information fields, development and tissue function. Beyond the genetic alterations of the tumor cell, the demonstration of an altered ecosystem, with interconnections at systemic levels, opens up a new perspective on cancer biology and behavior. Different tumor facets, such as morphology, classification, clinical aggressiveness, prognosis and response to treatment now appear under a comprehensive vision that offers a new horizon of study, research and clinical management. The Somatic Mutation Theory in cancer, in force for more than one hundred years, is now completed by the study of the tumor microenvironment, the extracellular matrix, the stromal cells, the immune response, the innervation, the nutrition, the mitochondria, the metabolism, the interstitial fluid, the mechanical and electromagnetic properties of the tissue and many other areas of emerging knowledge; thus opening the door to a reprogramming exercise of the tumor phenotype through the modification of the keys offered by this new paradigm. Its recognition makes it possible to go from considering the oncological process as a cellular problem to a supracellular alteration based on the disorganization of tissues, immersed in the relationships of the complex system of the living being.
