Title: The differential diagnosis of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN): the updated WHO criteria.
Abstract: The classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are characterized by clonal myeloproliferation without features of myelodysplasia. The diagnostic approach proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) uses clinical features, peripheral blood counts and smear analysis, bone marrow (BM) morphology, karyotype and molecular genetic tests to classify MPN subtypes. The detection of characteristic driver mutations like JAK2V617F, JAK2 exon 12, MPL, and calrecticulin (CALR) is a major diagnostic feature. JAK2 mutations are detected in more than 90% of patients with PV and are therefore used as highly sensitive clonal marker in this subtype. However, JAK2 mutations may also occur in ET and PMF, while CALR is virtually not seen in PV. Therefore, BM remains the central diagnostic platform and is essential for distinguishing ET from pre-fibrotic PMF and diagnosing cases which do not express JAK2, MPL or CALR ('wild-type' or 'triple-negative' MPN). The standardization of relevant BM features is mandatory to recognize characteristic and easy to assess patterns that enable an accurate discrimination between the MPN subtypes. Key parameters include cellularity, erythropoiesis and neutrophil granulopoiesis in context with specific features of megakaryocytes as well as the BM fiber content, especially in early stage MPN that present with thrombocytosis and clinically mimic essential thrombocythemia.
