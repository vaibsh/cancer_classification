Title: Surgical Management of Carcinoma Vulva-Case Series and Review of Literature.
Abstract: The objective of this study was to study the risk factors, management protocols, and the outcome of vulvar cancer cases over a period of 2 years in a tertiary care hospital. This is a case series of early-stage vulvar cancer in the Department of Surgical Oncology in BL Kapur Superspeciality Hospital from Jan 2016 to date. Five patients with histologically proven diagnosis of early-stage vulvar cancer were included. The mean age for the diagnosis of vulvar cancer was 58 years and the peak incidence was seen in postmenopausal age group. All of the cases were squamous cell carcinomas in stage IB except one which was a basisquamous variant. All cases were treated primarily with surgery and vulvar flap reconstruction. Adjuvant therapy was not given in any case. Cases were followed from 6 months to date, and no recurrence noted. The limitations of the study were rarity of disease and less number of cases. As all the cases in our study were in early stage of disease (stages I and II), surgical treatment in the form of modified radical vulvectomy with B/L inguinofemoral lymph node dissection and oncoplastic procedure was the treatment modality chosen for all the patients.
