Title: [Heterogeneity of genomic alterations and clinical aspects in peripheral T-cell lymphoma: future perspectives].
Abstract: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies. Several recent comprehensive genomic studies characterize the genomic alterations of each PTCL type and reveal the complexity and heterogeneity. The updated World Health Organization classification has precisely distinguished "lymphoma" from "lymphoproliferative disorder" and has included a new entity based on the tumor phenotypes. Although establishing the classifications based on genomic alterations has been difficult because of heterogeneity, the genomic alterations may support the diagnosis. Establishing genomic alterations that act as predictive markers for clinical courses and/or therapeutic targets is needed in future studies using genomic alteration information. Since patients with PTCL generally have poor prognosis, establishing the target and standard therapies is one of the major issues to be addressed. In addition to clinicopathological and genomic analyses, patient-derived xenograft models can provide these therapeutic strategies. Integration of analyzed data is considered to promote future PTCL studies, leading to improved PTCL prognosis.
