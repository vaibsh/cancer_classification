Title: Evaluating the tumor biology of lung adenocarcinoma: A multimodal analysis.
Abstract: We evaluated the relationships among functional imaging modality such as PET-CT and DW-MRI and lung adenocarcinoma pathologic heterogeneity, extent of invasion depth, and tumor cellularity as a marker of tumor microenvironment.In total, 74 lung adenocarcinomas were prospectively included. All patients underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT and MRI before curative surgery. Pathology revealed 68 stage I tumors, 3 stage II tumors, and 3 stage IIIA tumors. Comprehensive histologic subtyping was performed for all surgically resected tumors. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and ADC values were correlated with pathologic grade, extent of invasion, solid tumor size, and tumor cellularity.Mean solid tumor size (low: 1.7 +- 3.0 mm, indeterminate: 13.9 +- 14.2 mm, and high grade: 30.3 +- 13.5 mm) and SUVmax (low: 1.5 +- 0.2, indeterminate: 3.5 +- 2.5, and high grade: 15.3 +- 0) had a significant relationship with pathologic grade based on 95% confidence intervals (P = .01 and P < .01, respectively). SUVmax showed a strong correlation with tumor cellularity (R = 0.713, P < .001), but was not correlated with extent of invasion (R = 0.387, P = .148). A significant and strong positive correlation was observed among SUVmax values and higher cellularity and pathologic grade. ADC did not exhibit a significant relationship with tumor cellularity.Intratumor heterogeneity quantification using a multimodal-multiparametric approach might be effective when tumor volume consists of a real tumor component as well as a non-tumorous stromal component.
