Title: Malignant phyllodes tumor in Lynch syndrome: a case report.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome, or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, is an autosomal dominant genetic syndrome that predisposes individuals to multiple cancer types. The known cancers associated with Lynch syndrome include colorectal and endometrial cancers as well as cancers of the stomach, ovary, urinary tract, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, small bowel, and brain. There are no searchable cases of malignant phyllodes of the breast associated with Lynch syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 43-year-old Caucasian woman who felt a lump in her left breast and was found to have a spindle cell neoplasm. Definitive surgery revealed a malignant phyllodes tumor. On the basis of her cancer diagnosis and family history of multiple cancers, a Myriad myRisk Hereditary Cancer  test panel of 25 genes was performed. This testing revealed that she had a heterozygous MSH6 mutation as part of the Lynch syndrome panel. Due to positive margins, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide. She also had a subsequent total abdominal hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for risk reduction. She remains in a high-risk surveillance program. Her family members have been tested, which revealed that her two brothers and daughter also carry the genetic mutation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of genetic testing with rare malignancies because the full scope of phenotypic sequelae for known hereditary syndromes has not been mapped.
