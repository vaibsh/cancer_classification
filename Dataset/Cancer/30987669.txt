Title: LINC01354 interacting with hnRNP-D contributes to the proliferation and metastasis in colorectal cancer through activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to play an important role in the development and progression of various tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the regulatory molecular mechanism by lncRNA in CRC initiation and progression has not been fully clarified. METHODS: TCGA database was used to identify the involvement of LINC01354 in CRC. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to determine RNA and protein expression. The gain- and loss-of-function assays were conducted to explore the function of LINC01354 in the progression of CRC. In order to investigate the LINC01354-mediated mRNA in CRC tumorigenesis, we applied the profiling analysis as well as GO and KEGG analysis. Pulldown and RIP assays were applied to detect the interaction of hnRNP-D with LINC01354 and beta-catenin. RESULTS: The upregulation of LINC01354 in CRC and its prognostic significance were identified by TCGA database and confirmed in CRC tissues. Functionally, forced expression of LINC01354 promoted, while knockdown of LINC01354 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and EMT phenotype formation of CRC cells. A significant enrichment of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway genes under LINC01354 overexpression. In addition, LINC01354 modulated the mRNA stability of beta-catenin through interacting with hnRNP-D, thereby activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations proposed novel regulatory axis of LINC01354/hnRNP-D/Wnt/beta-catenin, which might be in favor of exploring novel therapeutic regimens for the clinical treatment of CRC.
