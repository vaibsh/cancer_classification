Title: Amplicon-based NGS test for assessing MLH1 promoter methylation and its correlation with BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer patients.
Abstract: Detecting MLH1 promoter methylation is highly relevant to differentiate between possible Lynch syndrome patients or patients with sporadic causes of MLH1/PMS2 deficiency in colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancers. Here, we aimed to develop a test for assessing MLH1 promoter methylation based in next generation sequencing (NGS), and to evaluate the concordance of MLH1 methylation and BRAF-V600 mutation status in CRC. For that, we performed a series of experiments with DNA from tumor, saliva and commercial control samples and our in house developed amplicon-based NGS test. In patients' samples, MLH1 methylation above 10% was only observed in tumors with MLH1/PMS2 loss. We confirmed the reproducibility and accuracy of MLH1 promoter analysis performing a serial dilution experiment with completely methylated and unmethylated control DNAs and a comparison between two NGS platforms (Ion Proton and Illumina). In MLH1/PMS2 deficient tumors, the MLH1 methylation status was concordant with the BRAF mutation status in 90% (18/20) of the cases. Our amplicon-based NGS test showed a great sensitivity and specificity for detecting MLH1 methylation in CRC samples, with a high agreement with the evaluation of BRAF mutation. This simple and affordable test could be used as a reflex test to identify patients with sporadic causes of MLH1/PMS2 deficiency in CRC, aiding to genetic test referral and identification of Lynch syndrome patients.
