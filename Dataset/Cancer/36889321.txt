Title: PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy as preoperative therapy for patients with BRPC/LAPC: A biomolecular exploratory, phase II trial.
Abstract: This is a phase II study of PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy as preoperative therapy for patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC or BRPC, respectively). Twenty-nine patients are enrolled in the study. The objective response rate (ORR) is 60%, and the R0 resection rate is 90% (9/10). The 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate and 12-month overall survival (OS) rate are 64% and 72%, respectively. Grade 3 or higher adverse events are anemia (8%), thrombocytopenia (8%), and jaundice (8%). Circulating tumor DNA analysis reveals that patients with a >50% decline in maximal somatic variant allelic frequency (maxVAF) between the first clinical evaluation and baseline have a longer survival outcome and a higher response rate and surgical rate than those who are not. PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy as preoperative therapy displays promising antitumor activity, and multiomics potential predictive biomarkers are identified and warrant further verification.
