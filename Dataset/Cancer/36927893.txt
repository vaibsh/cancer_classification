Title: [Orthopaedic Management of Bone Metastasis].
Abstract: Thanks to advancement in cancer therapy, an increasing number of cancer patients are expected to live longer with cancer in Japan. Activities of daily living(ADL)and quality of life(QOL)of cancer patients has become much more important than ever. Because a decline in mobility negatively affects ADL and QOL, the management of locomotive organs of cancer patients is crucial. In 2018, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association decided their annual activity theme as"locomotive syndrome in cancer patients", with the concept of preventing and improving locomotive syndrome for longer and healthier life of cancer patients. Bone metastasis, as a major cause of locomotive syndrome in cancer patients, needs to be evaluated and managed properly for better ADL and QOL of cancer patients. Pathological fractures, spinal instability, and spinal injury cause not only severe pain and massive functional impairment of patients but increased nursing care burden. To resolve these problems, surgery plays a major role. Possible surgical procedures include internal fixation, curettage, cementation, and arthroplasty for the long bones, whereas percutaneous vertebroplasty, decompression, posterior/anterior spinal fusion, and total en bloc spondylectomy for the spine. Less invasive surgical procedure tends to be chosen for a patient with poorer prognosis. The main purpose of bone metastasis surgery is to maintain ADL and QOL of cancer patients hopefully during the remaining survival time; therefore, estimated survival should be considered when determining the surgical strategy. In addition, case-by- case careful peri-operative management is required because cancer therapy can vary widely in patient age, cancer type, and tumor stage. To accommodate the variety of orthopaedic surgeries to the diversity of cancer therapy, the corporation between oncologists and orthopaedic surgeons is indispensable.
