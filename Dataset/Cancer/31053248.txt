Title: Receptor radionuclide targeting for neuroendocrine tumors (NET) diagnostic and therapy.
Abstract: Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) represent a heterogeneous group of tumors originating from cells of neuroendocrine origin, which express somatostatin receptors (SSTR). This property allowed the successful development of radionuclides for diagnostic and peptide radionuclide radiation therapy (PRRT). This is the paradigm for the theragnostic concept in NET personalized medicine. The only phase III study to date (NETTER-1) clearly demonstrated the ability of 177Lutetium-based PRRT to improve progression-free survival in advanced intestinal NETs. In clinical practice, the indications are limited to G1-G2 well-differentiated NETs with high expression of SSTR. NETs with a low tumor burden and slow progression are probably the optimal indication. This treatment is now available in France. However, its precise position in the treatment algorithm remains to be explored. We provide an overview of receptor radionuclide utilization and mechanism in diagnostic and pretherapeutic imaging and we focus on PRRT for endocrine tumors.
