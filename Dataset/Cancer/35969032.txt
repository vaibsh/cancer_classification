Title: LIBRETTO-531: a phase III study of selpercatinib in multikinase inhibitor-na√Øve <i>RET</i>-mutant medullary thyroid cancer.
Abstract: Selpercatinib is a first-in-class, highly selective and potent, central nervous system-active <i>RET</i> kinase inhibitor. In the phase I/II trial, selpercatinib demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor activity with manageable toxicity in heavily pre-treated and treatment-naive patients with <i>RET</i>-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). LIBRETTO-531 (NCT04211337) is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, phase III trial comparing selpercatinib to cabozantinib or vandetanib in patients with advanced/metastatic <i>RET</i>-mutant MTC. The primary objective is to compare progression-free survival (per RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review of patients with progressive, advanced, multikinase inhibitor-naive, <i>RET</i>-mutant MTC treated with selpercatinib versus cabozantinib or vandetanib. Key secondary objectives are to compare other efficacy outcomes (per RECIST 1.1) and tolerability of selpercatinib versus cabozantinib or vandetanib.
